this paper studies the importance of heterogeneous beliefs for the dynamics of asset prices we focus on currency markets where the absence of shortselling constraints allows us to perform sharper tests of theoretical predictions using a unique data set with detailed information on foreignexchange forecasts we construct an empirical proxy for differences in beliefs we show that this proxy has a strong effect on the implied volatility of currency options beyond the volatility of macroeconomic fundamentals we document that differences in beliefs impact also on the shape of the implied volatility smile on the volatility riskpremiums and on future currency returns elsevier bv
in the evaluation of supply chain process improvements the question of how to predict product demand quantity and prepare material flows in order to reduce cycle time has emerged as an important issue especially in the c computer communication and consumer electronic market this paper constructs a predicting model to deal with the product demand forecast problem with the aid of a growing hierarchical selforganizing maps and independent component analysis independent component analysis method is used to detect and remove the noise of data and further improve the performance of predicting model then growing hierarchical selforganizing maps is used to classify the data and after the classification support vector regression is applied to construct the product demand forecasting model in the experimental results the model proposed in this paper can be successfully applied in the forecasting problem elsevier bv all rights reserved
in the civil aviation market overbooking has been a common approach for airlines to recover losses caused by cancelation and noshows however overbooking would bring even more uncertainty into the system sometimes as a solution a new policy named transference is being implemented among flights in the route between shanghai and beijing by lots of airlines such as china eastern airlines china southern airlines and shanghai airlines this policy enables overflow passengers resulted from overbooking to take a later flight with a certain amount of compensations while passengers who arrive at the airport ahead of their schedule to board any early flights with surplus capacity freely as a result the uncertainty is decreased while the revenue is increased in this paper we establish a model to describe the situation design a procedure to handle two key problems in the model the optimal transferring quantity among flights with different departure times and the overbooking limit of each flight and show the revenue situation under the policy at the end of the paper we present a numerical example which shows our results coincide with reality elsevier bv all rights reserved
many theories in finance imply monotonic patterns in expected returns and other financial variables the liquidity preference hypothesis predicts higher expected returns for bonds with longer times to maturity the capital asset pricing model capm implies higher expected returns for stocks with higher betas and standard asset pricing models imply that the pricing kernel is declining in market returns the full set of implications of monotonicity is generally not exploited in empirical work however this paper proposes new and simple ways to test for monotonicity in financial variables and compares the proposed tests with extant alternatives such as ttests bonferroni bounds and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations elsevier bv

in a global economic environment many enterprises expend their overseas markets and implement outsourcing of logistics activities to external carriers many enterprises pay close attention to successful delivery of their freight hence how to determine the optimal carrier selection is a very critical issue for global enterprises generally there are several carriers to serve on each route connecting two cities or transfer stations in the logistics network each carrier owns multiple available capacities with a probability distribution because the carriers capacity may be partially reserved for other orders a carrier selection means selecting exact one carrier on each route and the logistics network according to the carrier selection is thus a stochastic logistic network the network reliability is a performance index of freight delivery for supply chain management and is defined as the probability that d units of commodity are successfully transmitted from a supplier to a customer this study focuses on the optimal carrier selection problem based on network reliability criterion a gabased algorithm that combines the minimal paths and the recursive sum of disjoint products is developed to determine the optimal carrier selection with the maximal network reliability a practical logistics example of the lcd monitors delivery from asia to europe is presented to illustrate the solution procedure elsevier bv all rights reserved

effective and efficient strategic decision making is the backbone for the success of a business organization these decision making processes used among its competitors in a particular industry determine whether the business will continue to survive or not in this research fuzzy logic fl concept and game theory are being used to model strategic decision making processes by business organizations competition between business organizations is viewed as a game with each business organization as a player a player formulates his own decisions by making his strategic moves based on uncertain information this is the information he has about the opponents with respect to prevailing or anticipated market demand cost of production marketing consolidation efforts and some other business variables this uncertain information is being modelled using the concept of fuzzy logic the game is played between a fuzzy agent and human agents in a resource allocation game between two players with uncertain information moreover fuzzy rules are constructed that symbolize various rules and strategic variables that a firm takes into consideration before taking a decision our model also includes a learning procedure that enables the agent to optimize the fuzzy rules and his decision processes matlab software was used for the design and implementation of the fuzzy decision making system and this procedure and methodology can be easily implemented by business managers and can assist them in their strategic policy formulation elsevier bvall rights reserved
when the pricing kernel is ushaped then expected returns of claims with payout on the upside are negative for strikes beyond a threshold determined by the slope of the ushaped kernel in its increasing region and have negative partial derivative with respect to strike in the increasing region of the kernel using returns of i sp index calls ii calls on major international equity indexes iii digital calls iv upside variance contracts and v a theoretical construct that we denote as kernel call we find broad support for the implications of ushaped pricing kernels a possible theoretical reconciliation of our empirical findings is explored through a model that accommodates heterogeneity in beliefs about return outcomes and shortselling elsevier bv
this paper develops an inventory model of a volume flexible manufacturing system for a deteriorating item with randomly distributed shelf life continuous timevarying demand and shortages over a finite time horizon it is assumed that the produced units deteriorate over time with uncertainty that follows different distributions uniform distribution two parameters weibull distribution total cost is derived for the system and minimized genetic algorithm ga is developed with roulette wheel selection arithmetic crossover random mutation and applied to evaluate the minimum total cost and the corresponding optimum decision variables the model is illustrated with some numerical data here we present the fractional factorial design approach for this model along with its practical implication also some sensitivity analyses for the total cost with respect to some system parameters are presented elsevier bvall rights reserved
the preferred risk habitat hypothesis introduced here is that individual investors select stocks whose volatilities are commensurate with their risk aversion the data holdings of over clients at a large german broker are consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis the returns of stocks within each portfolio have remarkably similar volatilities when stocks are sold they are replaced by stocks of similar volatilities and the more riskaverse customers indeed hold less volatile stocks greater volatility specialization is associated with lower sharpe ratios primarily because more specialized investors hold fewer stocks and thereby expose themselves to more unsystematic risk elsevier bv
the adoption of open architecture has several economic implications in the life of an asset including developmental production storage training and maintenance costs this research responds to an inquiry by the program executive officerintegrated weapons system us department of the navy regarding the value of open architecture oa in the design of complex assets with this intent we evaluate how the inventory allocation of spare engines for the f operations in the continental united states would be affected with and without the adoption of open architecture focusing on the benefits of inventory pooling to meet the demand of many users from a small number of storage sites we use a distanceconstrained version of the ardalan heuristic for solving the facility location problem responding to practical limitations exposed by the model this article shows that open architecture may provide substantial supply chain cost reduction and simplification of the distribution network when combined with proper inventory storage policies elsevier bvall rights reserved

in this paper a singlevendor singlebuyer supply chain for fixed lifetime product is considered we propose models to analyze the benefit of coordinating supply chain through quantity discount strategy under the proposed strategy the buyer is requested to alter his current order size such that the vendor can benefit from lower costs and quantity discount is offered by the vendor to compensate the buyer for his increased inventory cost and possibly provide an additional savings in addition the centralized decisionmaking model is formulated to examine the effectiveness of the proposed quantity discount model it is proved that the quantity discount strategy can achieve system optimization and winwin outcome at last a detailed numerical example is presented to illustrate the benefit of the proposed strategy
assuming that firms suppliers are better able to extract value from the liquidation of assets in default and have an information advantage over other creditors the paper derives six predictions on the use of trade credit financially unconstrained firms with unused bank credit lines take trade credit to exploit the suppliers liquidation advantage if inputs purchased on account are sufficiently liquid the reliance on trade credit does not depend on credit rationing firms buying goods make more purchases on account than those buying services while suppliers of services offer more trade credit than those of standardized goods suppliers lend inputs to their customers but not cash greater reliance on trade credit is associated with more intensive use of tangible inputs better creditor protection decreases both the use of trade credit and input tangibility elsevier bv

if the roll critique is important changes in the variance of the stock market may be only weakly related to changes in aggregate risk and subsequent stock market excess returns however since individual stock returns share a common sensitivity to true market return shocks higher aggregate risk can be revealed by higher correlation between stocks in addition a change in stock market variance that leaves aggregate risk unchanged can have a zero or even negative effect on the stock market risk premium we show that the average correlation between daily stock returns predicts subsequent quarterly stock market excess returns we also show that changes in stock market risk holding average correlation constant can be interpreted as changes in the average variance of individual stocks such changes have a negative relation with future stock market excess returns elsevier bv

this paper uses recent regulations that have required some companies to increase the number of outside directors on their boards to generate estimates of the effect of board independence on performance that are largely free from endogeneity problems our main finding is that the effectiveness of outside directors depends on the cost of acquiring information about the firm when the cost of acquiring information is low performance increases when outsiders are added to the board and when the cost of information is high performance worsens when outsiders are added to the board the estimates provide some of the cleanest estimates to date that board independence matters and the finding that board effectiveness depends on information cost supports a nascent theoretical literature emphasizing information asymmetry we also find that firms compose their boards as if they understand that outsider effectiveness varies with information costs elsevier bv

this paper establishes a robust link between the trading behavior of institutions and the booktomarket effect building on work by daniel and titman who argue that the booktomarket effect is driven by the reversal of intangible returns i find that institutions tend to buy sell shares in response to positive negative intangible information and that the reversal of the intangible return is most pronounced among stocks for which a large proportion of active institutions trade in the direction of intangible information furthermore the booktomarket effect is large and significant in stocks with intense past institutional trading but nonexistent in stocks with moderate institutional trading this influence of institutional trading on the booktomarket effect is distinct from that of firm size these results are consistent with the view that the tendency of institutions to trade in the direction of intangible information exacerbates price overreaction thereby contributing to the value premium elsevier bv all rights reserved

stocks with relatively high short interest subsequently experience negative abnormal returns but the effect can be transient and of debatable economic significance in contrast relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns these positive returns are often larger in absolute value than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks thus the positive information associated with low short interest which is publicly available is only slowly incorporated into prices which raises a broader market efficiency issue our results also cast doubt on existing theories of the impact of short sale constraints elsevier bv all rights reserved

we develop a reducedform approach for valuing callable corporate bonds by characterizing the call probability via an intensity process asymmetric information and market frictions justify the existence of a callarrival intensity from the markets perspective our approach both extends the reducedform model of duffie and singleton for defaultable bonds to callable bonds and captures some important differences between call and default decisions a comprehensive empirical analysis of callable bonds using both our model and the more traditional american option approach for valuing callable bonds shows that the reducedform model fits callable bond prices well and that it outperforms the traditional approach both in and outofsample elsevier bv all rights reserved
deregulation significantly affects the firms operating environment and leverage decisions firms experience a significant decline in profitability asset tangibility and a significant increase in growth opportunities following deregulation firms respond by reducing leverage deregulation also significantly affects the crosssectional relation between leverage and its determinants leverage is much less negatively correlated with profitability and markettobook and much more positively negatively correlated with firm size earnings volatility following deregulation these results are consistent with the dynamic tradeoff theory of capital structure also consistent with the dynamic tradeoff theory those firms that are more likely to be above their target capital structure issue significantly more equity in the first few years following deregulation elsevier bv all rights reserved
during the financial crisis that started in the us government has used a variety of tools to try to rehabilitate the us banking industry many of those strategies were also used in japan to combat its banking problems in the s there are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current us crisis and the recent japanese crisis the japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in from these unsuccessful attempts we derive eight lessons in light of these eight lessons we assess the policies the us has pursued the us has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the us policies with respect to four of the others so far the us has avoided japans problem of having impaired banks prop up zombie firms elsevier bv
this paper proposes a risk measure based on firstpassage probability which reflects intrahorizon risk in jump models with finite or infinite jump activity our empirical investigation shows first that the proposed risk measure consistently exceeds the benchmark valueatrisk var second jump risk tends to amplify intrahorizon risk third we find large variation in our risk measure across jump models indicative of model risk fourth among the jump models we consider the finitemoment logstable model provides the most conservative risk estimates fifth imposing more stringent var levels accentuates the impact of intrahorizon risk in jump models finally using an alternative benchmark var does not dilute the role of intrahorizon risk overall we contribute by showing that ignoring intrahorizon risk can lead to underestimation of risk exposures elsevier bv all rights reserved
this paper represents an equilibrium model for the demand and supply of liquidity and its impact on asset prices and welfare we show that when constant market presence is costly purely idiosyncratic shocks lead to endogenous demand of liquidity and large price deviations from fundamentals moreover market forces fail to lead to efficient supply of liquidity which calls for potential policy interventions however we demonstrate that different policy tools can yield different efficiency consequences for example lowering the cost of supplying liquidity on the spot eg through direct injection of liquidity or relaxation of ex post margin constraints can decrease welfare while forcing more liquidity supply eg through coordination of market participants can improve welfare elsevier bv all rights reserved
this paper documents frequent attempts by activist arbitrageurs to openend discounted closedend funds particularly after the proxy reform which reduced the costs of communication among shareholders openending attempts have a substantial effect on discounts reducing them on average to half of their original level the size of the discount is a major determinant of whether a fund gets attacked other important factors include the costs of communication among shareholders and the governance structure of the targeted fund our study contributes to the understanding of the actions undertaken by arbitrageurs in financial markets beyond just pure trading elsevier bv all rights reserved
taxes represent a significant cost to the firm and shareholders and it is generally expected that shareholders prefer tax aggressiveness however this argument ignores potential nontax costs that can accompany tax aggressiveness especially those arising from agency problems firms ownedrun by founding family members are characterized by a unique agency conflict between dominant and small shareholders using multiple measures to capture tax aggressiveness and founding family presence we find that family firms are less tax aggressive than their nonfamily counterparts ceteris paribus this result suggests that family owners are willing to forgo tax benefits to avoid the nontax cost of a potential price discount which can arise from minority shareholders concern with family rentseeking masked by tax avoidance activities desai and dharmapala corporate tax avoidance and highpowered incentives journal of financial economics our result is also consistent with family owners being more concerned with the potential penalty and reputation damage from an irs audit than nonfamily firms we obtain similar inferences when using a small sample of tax shelter cases elsevier bv all rights reserved

between and wr hambrecht completed initial public offerings ipos in the us using an auction mechanism we analyze investor behavior and mechanism performance in these auctioned ipos using detailed bidding data the existence of some bids posted at high prices suggests that some investors mostly retail try to freeride on the mechanism but institutional demand in these auctions is very elastic suggesting that institutional investors reveal information in the bidding process investor participation is largely predictable based on deal size and demand is dominated by institutions flipping is at most as prevalent in auctions as in bookbuilt deals but unlike in bookbuilding investors in auctions do not flip their shares more in hot deals finally we find that institutional investors who provide more information are rewarded by obtaining a larger share of the deals that have higher day underpricing our results therefore suggest that auctioned ipos can be an effective alternative to traditional bookbuilding elsevier bv

during the financial crisis there was little or no trading in a variety of financial assets even though bid and ask prices existed for many of these assets we develop a model in which this illiquidity arises from uncertainty and we argue that this new form of illiquidity makes bid and ask prices unsuitable as metrics for establishing fair value for these assets we show how the extreme uncertainty that traders face can be characterized by incomplete preferences over portfolios and we use bewleys model of decision making under uncertainty to derive equilibrium quotes and the nonexistence of trading at these quotes we then suggest alternatives for valuing assets in illiquid markets elsevier bv

collateral constraints imply that financing and risk management are fundamentally linked the opportunity cost of engaging in risk management and conserving debt capacity to hedge future financing needs is forgone current investment and is higher for more productive and less wellcapitalized firms more constrained firms engage in less risk management and may exhaust their debt capacity and abstain from risk management consistent with empirical evidence and in contrast to received theory when cash flows are low such firms may be unable to seize investment opportunities and be forced to downsize consequently capital may be less productively deployed in downturns the american finance association
we examine how a firms incentive to commit fraud when going public varies with investor beliefs about industry business conditions fraud propensity increases with the level of investor beliefs about industry prospects but decreases when beliefs are extremely high we find that two mechanisms are at work monitoring by investors and shortterm executive compensation both of which vary with investor beliefs about industry prospects we also find that monitoring incentives of investors and underwriters differ our results are consistent with models of investor beliefs and corporate fraud and suggest that regulators and auditors should be vigilant for fraud during booms the american finance association
we use exogenous variation in tax benefit functions to estimate firmspecific cost of debt functions that are conditional on company characteristics such as collateral size and booktomarket by integrating the area between the benefit and cost functions we estimate that the equilibrium net benefit of debt is of asset value resulting from an estimated gross benefit cost of debt equal to of asset value we find that the cost of being overlevered is asymmetrically higher than the cost of being underlevered and that expected default costs constitute only half of the total ex ante costs of debt the american finance association
this paper argues that the legacy potential of a firms strategy is an important determinant of ceo compensation turnover and strategy change a legacy makes ceo replacement expensive because firm performance can only partially be attributed to a newly employed manager boards may therefore optimally allow an incumbent to be entrenched moreover when a firm changes strategy it is optimal to change the ceo because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail even though ceos have no specific skills in our model legacy issues can explain the empirical association between ceo and strategy change the american finance association

executive compensation influences managerial risk preferences through executives portfolio sensitivities to changes in stock prices delta and stock return volatility vega large deltas discourage managerial risktaking while large vegas encourage risktaking theory suggests that shortmaturity debt mitigates agency costs of debt by constraining managerial risk preferences we posit and find evidence of a negative positive relation between ceo portfolio deltas vegas and shortmaturity debt we also find that shortmaturity debt mitigates the influence of vega and deltarelated incentives on bond yields overall our empirical evidence shows that shortterm debt mitigates agency costs of debt arising from compensation risk the american finance association
the monthly volatility of ipo initial returns is substantial fluctuates dramatically over time and is considerably larger during hot ipo markets consistent with ipo theory the volatility of initial returns is higher for firms that are more difficult to value because of higher information asymmetry our findings highlight underwriters difficulty in valuing companies characterized by high uncertainty and raise serious questions about the efficacy of the traditional firmcommitment ipo process one implication of our results is that alternate mechanisms such as auctions could be beneficial for firms that value price discovery over the auxiliary services provided by underwriters the american finance association
we argue that time variation in the maturity of corporate debt arises because firms behave as macro liquidity providers absorbing the supply shocks associated with changes in the maturity structure of government debt we document that when the government funds itself with more shortterm debt firms fill the resulting gap by issuing more longterm debt and vice versa this type of liquidity provision is undertaken more aggressively when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher and by firms with stronger balance sheets our theory sheds new light on market timing phenomena in corporate finance more generally the american finance association

we show that institutions that promote financial development ease borrowing constraints by lowering the collateral spread and shifting the composition of acceptable collateral towards firmspecific assets collateral spread is defined as the difference in collateralization rates between high and lowrisk borrowers the average collateral spread is large but declines rapidly with improvements in financial development driven by stronger institutions we also show that the composition of collateralizable assets shifts towards nonspecific assets eg land with borrower risk however the shift is considerably smaller in developed financial markets enabling risky borrowers to use a larger variety of assets as collateral the american finance association
incubation is a strategy for initiating new funds where multiple funds are started privately and at the end of an evaluation period some are opened to the public consistent with incubation being used by fund families to increase performance and attract flows funds in incubation outperform nonincubated funds by riskadjusted and when they are opened to the public they attract higher flows postincubation however this outperformance disappears this performance reversal imparts an upward bias to returns that is not removed by a fund size filter fund age and ticker creation date filters however eliminate the bias the american finance association
while relaxation of geographical restrictions on bank expansion permitted banking organizations to expand across state lines it allowed states to erect barriers to branch expansion these differences in states branching restrictions affect credit supply in states more open to branching small firms borrow at interest rates to basis points lower than firms operating in less open states firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks despite this evidence that interstate branch openness expands credit supply we find no effect of variation in state restrictions on branching on the amount that small firms borrow the american finance association
we develop a technique to assess the impact of changes in mortgage markets on households exploiting an implication of the permanent income hypothesis the higher a households expected future income the higher its desired consumption ceteris paribus with perfect credit markets desired consumption matches actual consumption and current spending forecasts future income because credit market imperfections mute this effect the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures the imperfectness of mortgage markets using microdata we find that since the early s mortgage markets have become less imperfect in this sense and securitization has played an important role the american finance association
in measuring performance persistence we use hedge fund style benchmarks this allows us to identify managers with valuable skills and also to control for optionlike features inherent in returns from hedge fund strategies we take into account the possibility that reported asset values may be based on stale prices we develop a statistical model that relates a hedge funds performance to its decision to liquidate or close in order to infer the performance of a hedge fund that left the database although we find significant performance persistence among superior funds we find little evidence of persistence among inferior funds the american finance association

traditional real options models demonstrate the importance of the option to wait due to uncertainty over future shocks to project cash flows however there is often another important source of uncertainty uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks adding bayesian uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks augments the traditional option to wait with an additional option to learn the implied investment behavior differs significantly from that in standard models for example investment may occur at a time of stable or decreasing cash flows respond sluggishly to cash flow shocks and depend on the timing of project cash flows the american finance association
this paper examines how cultural differences influence the returns of momentum strategies crosscountry cultural differences are measured with an individualism index developed by hofstede which is related to overconfidence and selfattribution bias we find that individualism is positively associated with trading volume and volatility as well as to the magnitude of momentum profits momentum profits are also positively related to analyst forecast dispersion transaction costs and the familiarity of the market to foreigners and negatively related to firm size and volatility however the addition of these and other variables does not dampen the relation between individualism and momentum profits the american finance association

this paper presents a model that reproduces the uncovered interest rate parity puzzle investors have preferences with external habits countercyclical risk premia and procyclical real interest rates arise endogenously during bad times at home when domestic consumption is close to the habit level the representative investor is very risk averse when the domestic investor is more risk averse than her foreign counterpart the exchange rate is closely tied to domestic consumption growth shocks the domestic investor therefore expects a positive currency excess return because interest rates are low in bad times expected currency excess returns increase with interest rate differentials the american finance association

stapled finance is a loan commitment arranged by a seller in an ma setting whoever wins the bidding contest has the option not the obligation to accept this loan commitment we show that stapled finance increases bidding competition by subsidizing weak bidders who raise their bids and thereby the price that strong bidders who are more likely to win must pay the lender expects not to break even and must be compensated for offering the loan this reduces but does not eliminate the sellers benefit it also implies that stapled finance loans will show poorer performance than other buyout loans the american finance association
we identify different sources of risk as important determinants of banks corporate structures when expanding into new markets subsidiarybased corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliatelevel limited liability but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches thus branchbased structures are preferred to subsidiarybased structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk and vice versa greater crosscountry risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures furthermore a banks corporate structure affects its risk taking and affiliate size the american finance association
consistent with recent theoretical models where binding capital constraints lead to sudden liquidity dryups we find that negative market returns decrease stock liquidity especially during times of tightness in the funding market the asymmetric effect of changes in aggregate asset values on liquidity and commonality in liquidity cannot be fully explained by changes in demand for liquidity or volatility effects we document interindustry spillover effects in liquidity which are likely to arise from capital constraints in the market making sector we also find economically significant returns to supplying liquidity following periods of large drops in market valuations the american finance association
i describe asset price dynamics caused by the slow movement of investment capital to trading opportunities the pattern of price responses to supply or demand shocks typically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a subsequent and more extended reversal the amplitude of the immediate price impact and the pattern of the subsequent recovery can reflect institutional impediments to immediate trade such as search costs for trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries i discuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent financial crisis that caused asset price distortions which subsided afterward after presenting examples of price reactions to supply shocks in normal market settings i offer a simple illustrative model of price dynamics associated with slowmoving capital due to the presence of inattentive investors the american finance association

we study price discovery in municipal bonds an important otc market as in markets for consumer goods prices rise faster than they fall roundtrip profits to dealers on retail trades increase in rising markets but do not decrease in falling markets further effective halfspreads increase or decrease more when movements in fundamentals favor dealers yield spreads relative to treasuries also adjust with asymmetric speed in rising and falling markets finally intraday price dispersion is asymmetric in rising and falling markets as consumer search theory would predict the american finance association
implicit tax rates priced in the cross section of municipal bonds are approximately two to three times as high as statutory income tax rates with implicit tax rates close to using retail trades and above for interdealer trades these implied tax rates can be identified because a portion of secondary market municipal bond trades involves income taxes after valuing the tax payments market discount bonds which carry income tax liabilities trade at yields around basis points higher than comparable municipal bonds not subject to any taxes the high sensitivities of municipal bond prices to tax rates can be traced to individual retail traders dominating dealers and other institutions the american finance association
the paper tests whether individuals have valuerelevant information about local stocks where local is defined as being headquartered near where an investor lives our methodology uses two types of calendartime portfoliosone based on holdings and one based on transactions portfolios of local holdings do not generate abnormal performance alphas are zero when studying transactions purchases of local stocks significantly underperform sales of local stocks the underperformance remains when focusing on stocks with potentially high levels of information asymmetries we conclude that individuals do not help incorporate information into stock prices our conclusions directly contradict existing studies the american finance association
this paper investigates the relation between firms locations and their corporate finance decisions we develop a model where being located within an industry cluster increases opportunities to make acquisitions and to facilitate those acquisitions firms within clusters maintain more financial slack consistent with our model we find that firms located within industry clusters make more acquisitions and have lower debt ratios and larger cash balances than their industry peers located outside clusters we also document that firms in hightech cities and growing cities maintain more financial slack overall the evidence suggests that growth opportunities influence firms financial decisions the american finance association
to identify the most effective mechanisms for detecting corporate fraud we study all reported fraud cases in large us companies between and we find that fraud detection does not rely on standard corporate governance actors investors sec and auditors but rather takes a village including several nontraditional players employees media and industry regulators differences in access to information as well as monetary and reputational incentives help to explain this pattern indepth analyses suggest that reputational incentives in general are weak except for journalists in large cases by contrast monetary incentives help explain employee whistleblowing the american finance association
financial regulation was as hotly debated a political issue in the th century as it is today we study the political economy of state usury laws in th century america exploiting the wide variation in regulation enforcement and economic conditions across states and time we find that usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity especially for smaller firms we examine the motives of regulation and find that usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring wealthy political incumbents particularly when they have more voting power the evidence suggests financial regulation is driven by private interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests protecting the underserved the american finance association
the empirical evidence on investor disagreement and trading volume is difficult to reconcile in standard rational expectations models we develop a dynamic model in which investors disagree about the interpretation of public information we obtain a closedform linear equilibrium that allows us to study which restrictions on the disagreement process yield empirically observed volume and return dynamics we show that when investors have infrequent but major disagreements there is positive autocorrelation in volume and positive correlation between volume and volatility we also derive novel empirical predictions that relate the degree and frequency of disagreement to volume and volatility dynamics the american finance association
we assess the impact of bank deregulation on the distribution of income in the united states from the s through the s most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching which intensified bank competition and improved bank performance exploiting the crossstate crosstime variation in the timing of branch deregulation we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median bank deregulation tightened the distribution of income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled workers the american finance association
over the period to the us dollar particularly in relation to the canadian dollar the euro and the swiss franc particularly in the second half of the period moved against world equity markets thus these currencies should be attractive to riskminimizing global equity investors despite their low average returns the riskminimizing currency strategy for a global bond investor is close to a full currency hedge with a modest long position in the us dollar there is little evidence that riskminimizing investors should adjust their currency positions in response to movements in interest differentials the american finance association
we propose a latent variables approach within a presentvalue model to estimate the expected returns and expected dividend growth rates of the aggregate stock market this approach aggregates information contained in the history of pricedividend ratios and dividend growth rates to predict future returns and dividend growth rates we find that returns and dividend growth rates are predictable with values ranging from to for returns and to for dividend growth rates both expected returns and expected dividend growth rates have a persistent component but expected returns are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates the american finance association
we examine whether strong networks among incumbent venture capitalists vcs in local markets help restrict entry by outside vcs thus improving incumbents bargaining power over entrepreneurs more densely networked markets experience less entry with a onestandard deviation increase in network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately onethird entrants with established ties to targetmarket incumbents appear able to overcome this barrier to entry in turn incumbents react strategically to an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate entry into their market incumbents appear to benefit from reduced entry by paying lower prices for their deals the american finance association
social status concerns influence investors decisions by driving a wedge in attitudes toward aggregate and idiosyncratic risks i model such concerns by emphasizing the desire to get ahead of the joneses which implies that aversion to idiosyncratic risk is lower than aversion to aggregate risk the model predicts that investors hold concentrated portfolios in equilibrium which helps rationalize the small premium for undiversified entrepreneurial risk in the model status concerns are more important for wealthier households consequently these households own a disproportionate share of risky assets particularly private equity and experience greater volatility of consumption consistent with empirical evidence the american finance association
motivated by the literature on investment flows and optimal trading we examine intraday predictability in the crosssection of stock returns we find a striking pattern of return continuation at halfhour intervals that are exact multiples of a trading day and this effect lasts for at least trading days volume order imbalance volatility and bidask spreads exhibit similar patterns but do not explain the return patterns we also show that shortterm return reversal is driven by temporary liquidity imbalances lasting less than an hour and bidask bounce timing trades can reduce execution costs by the equivalent of the effective spread the american finance association
we examine how a firms incentive to commit fraud when going public varies with investor beliefs about industry business conditions fraud propensity increases with the level of investor beliefs about industry prospects but decreases when beliefs are extremely high we find that two mechanisms are at work monitoring by investors and shortterm executive compensation both of which vary with investor beliefs about industry prospects we also find that monitoring incentives of investors and underwriters differ our results are consistent with models of investor beliefs and corporate fraud and suggest that regulators and auditors should be vigilant for fraud during booms the american finance association
individuals differ in how they construct their investment portfolios yet empirical models of portfolio risk typically account only for a small portion of the crosssectional variance this paper asks whether genetic variation can explain some of these individual differences following a major pension reform swedish adults had to form a portfolio from a large menu of funds we match data on these investment decisions with the swedish twin registry and find that approximately of individual variation in portfolio risk is due to genetic variation we also find that these results extend to several other aspects of financial decisionmaking the american finance association
i study the asset pricing implications of the quality of public information about persistent productivity shocks in a general equilibrium model with krepsporteus preferences low information quality is associated with a high equity premium a low volatility of consumption growth and a low volatility of the riskfree interest rate the relationship between information quality and the equity premium differs from that in endowment economies my calibration improves substantially upon the bansalyaron model in terms of the moments of the wealthconsumption ratio and the return on aggregate wealth the american finance association
this paper revisits the theoretical relation between financial leverage and stock returns in a dynamic world where both corporate investment and financing decisions are endogenous we find that the link between leverage and stock returns is more complex than static textbook examples suggest and depends on the investment opportunities available to the firm in the presence of financial market imperfections leverage and investment are generally correlated so that highly levered firms are also mature firms with relatively more safe book assets and fewer risky growth opportunities a quantitative version of our model matches several stylized facts about leverage and returns the american finance association
individual investors lose money around earnings announcements experience poor posttrade returns exhibit the disposition effect and make contrarian trades using simulations and trading records of all individual investors in finland i find that these trading patterns can be explained in large part by investors use of limit orders these patterns arise mechanically because limit orders are pricecontingent and suffer from adverse selection reverse causality from behavioral biases to order choices does not appear to explain my findings i propose a simple method for measuring a data sets susceptibility to this limit order effect the american finance association
we examine whether short sellers detect firms that misrepresent their financial statements and whether their trading conveys external costs or benefits to other investors abnormal short interest increases steadily in the months before the misrepresentation is publicly revealed particularly when the misconduct is severe short selling is associated with a faster timetodiscovery and it dampens the share price inflation that occurs when firms misstate their earnings these results indicate that short sellers anticipate the eventual discovery and severity of financial misconduct they also convey external benefits helping to uncover misconduct and keeping prices closer to fundamental values the american finance association
the aggregate portfolio of actively managed us equity mutual funds is close to the market portfolio but the high costs of active management show up intact as lower returns to investors bootstrap simulations suggest that few funds produce benchmarkadjusted expected returns sufficient to cover their costs if we add back the costs in fund expense ratios there is evidence of inferior and superior performance nonzero true in the extreme tails of the crosssection of mutual fund estimates the american finance association
this paper studies loan conditions when firms switch banks recent theoretical work on bankfirm relationships motivates our matching models the dynamic cycle of the loan rate that we uncover is as follows a loan granted by a new outside bank carries a loan rate that is significantly lower than the rates on comparable new loans from the firms current inside banks the new bank initially decreases the loan rate further but eventually ratchets it up sharply other loan conditions follow a similar economically relevant pattern this bank strategy is consistent with the existence of holdup costs in bankfirm relationships the american finance association
we present evidence that reassigning tasks among agents can alleviate moral hazard in communication a rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers reporting behavior when an officer anticipates rotation reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrowers repayment prospects as a result the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports the threat of rotation improves communication because selfreporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officers career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor the american finance association
defining contagion as correlation over and above that expected from economic fundamentals we find strong evidence of worst return contagion across hedge fund styles for to large adverse shocks to asset and hedge fund liquidity strongly increase the probability of contagion specifically large adverse shocks to credit spreads the ted spread prime broker and bank stock prices stock market liquidity and hedge fund flows are associated with a significant increase in the probability of hedge fund contagion while shocks to liquidity are important determinants of performance these shocks are not captured by commonly used models of hedge fund returns the american finance association
this paper exploits a natural quasiexperiment to isolate the effects that were uniquely due to the sarbanesoxley act sox us firms with a public float under million could delay section compliance and foreign firms under million could delay the auditors attestation requirement as designed section led to conservative reported earnings but also imposed real costs on net sox compliance reduced the market value of small firms the american finance association
how does competition in firms product markets influence their behavior in equity markets do product market imperfections spread to equity markets we examine these questions in a noisy rational expectations model in which firms operate under monopolistic competition while their shares trade in perfectly competitive markets firms use their monopoly power to pass on shocks to customers thereby insulating their profits this encourages stock trading expedites the capitalization of private information into stock prices and improves the allocation of capital several implications are derived and tested the american finance association
we show that marketmaker balance sheet and income statement variables explain time variation in liquidity suggesting liquiditysupplier financing constraints matter using years of nyse specialist inventory positions and trading revenues we find that aggregate marketlevel and specialist firmlevel spreads widen when specialists have large positions or lose money the effects are nonlinear and most prominent when inventories are big or trading results have been particularly poor these sensitivities are smaller after specialist firm mergers consistent with deep pockets easing financing constraints finally compared to low volatility stocks the liquidity of high volatility stocks is more sensitive to inventories and losses the american finance association
i build a dynamic capital structure model that demonstrates how business cycle variation in expected growth rates economic uncertainty and risk premia influences firms financing policies countercyclical fluctuations in risk prices default probabilities and default losses arise endogenously through firms responses to macroeconomic conditions these comovements generate large credit risk premia for investment grade firms which helps address the credit spread puzzle and the underleverage puzzle in a unified framework the model generates interesting dynamics for financing and defaults including market timing in debt issuance and credit contagion it also provides a novel procedure to estimate statedependent default losses the american finance association
we model the debt and asset risk choice of a manager with performanceinsensitive pay cash and performancesensitive pay stock to theoretically link compensation structure leverage and credit spreads the model predicts that optimal leverage trades off the tax benefit of debt against the utility cost of expost asset substitution and that credit spreads are increasing in the ratio of cashtostock using a large crosssection of usbased corporate credit default swaps cds covering to we find a positive association between cashtostock and cds rates and between cashtostock and leverage ratios the american finance association
we study the impact of social networks on agents ability to gather superior information about firms exploiting novel data on the educational background of sellside analysts and senior corporate officers we find that analysts outperform by up to per year on their stock recommendations when they have an educational link to the company prereg fd this schooltie return premium is per year while postreg fd it is nearly zero in contrast in an environment that did not change selective disclosure regulation the uk the schooltie premium is large and significant over the entire sample period the american finance association
a goal for stock exchanges is to increase participation by firms and investors we show how specific features of the microstructure can reduce perceived ambiguity and induce participation by both investors and issuers we develop a model with sophisticated traders who we view as expected utility maximizers with rational expectations and unsophisticated traders who we view as rational traders facing ambiguity about the payoffs to participating in the market we show how designing markets to reduce ambiguity can benefit investors through greater liquidity exchanges through greater volume and issuing firms through a lower cost of capital the american finance association
this paper argues that the legacy potential of a firms strategy is an important determinant of ceo compensation turnover and strategy change a legacy makes ceo replacement expensive because firm performance can only partially be attributed to a newly employed manager boards may therefore optimally allow an incumbent to be entrenched moreover when a firm changes strategy it is optimal to change the ceo because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail even though ceos have no specific skills in our model legacy issues can explain the empirical association between ceo and strategy change the american finance association
this paper studies the relation between corporate liquidity and diversification the key finding is that multidivision firms hold significantly less cash than standalone firms because they are diversified in their investment opportunities lower crossdivisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between investment opportunity and cash flow correspond to lower cash holdings even after controlling for cash flow volatility the effects are strongest in financially constrained firms and in wellgoverned firms and correspond to efficient fund transfers from low to highproductivity divisions taken together these results bring forth an efficient link between diversification and corporate liquidity the american finance association
we examine how product market competition affects firm cash flows and stock returns in industry booms and busts our results show how real and financial factors interact in industry business cycles in competitive industries we find that high industrylevel stock market valuation investment and financing are followed by sharply lower operating cash flows and abnormal stock returns analyst estimates are positively biased and returns comove more in concentrated industries these relations are weak and generally insignificant our results are consistent with participants in competitive industries not fully internalizing the negative externality of industry competition on cash flows and stock returns the american finance association
i estimate the markets valuation of the net benefits to leverage using panel data from to identified from market values and betas of a companys debt and equity the median firm captures net benefits of up to of firm value small and profitable firms have high optimal leverage ratios as predicted by theory but in contrast to existing empirical evidence companies are on average slightly underlevered relative to the optimal leverage ratio at refinancing this result is mainly due to zero leverage firms i also look at implications for financial policy the american finance association
we develop a new and comprehensive database of firmlevel contributions to us political campaigns from to we construct variables that measure the extent of firm support for candidates we find that these measures are positively and significantly correlated with the crosssection of future returns the effect is strongest for firms that support a greater number of candidates that hold office in the same state that the firm is based in addition there are stronger effects for firms whose contributions are slanted toward house candidates and democrats the american finance association
this paper analyzes optimal executive compensation contracts when managers are loss averse we calibrate a stylized principalagent model to the observed contracts of ceos and show that this model can explain observed option holdings and high base salaries remarkably well for a range of parameterizations we also derive and calibrate the general shape of the optimal contract that is increasing and convex for medium and high outcomes and that drops discontinuously to the lowest possible payout for low outcomes finally we identify the critical features of the lossaversion model that render optimal contracts convex the american finance association
we examine the role of the state as entrepreneur and institutional entrepreneur in the middle east using historical event sequencing methodology we seek to understand the rise of dubai and the united arab emirates as a context for international entrepreneurship we build on ideas at the intersection of international entrepreneurship and institutional theory to develop a set of propositions that enhance our understanding of international entrepreneurship we provide implications for the management of both global and local legitimacy resource mobilization and agency as well as the strategic deployment of an institutional infrastructure to create and enable entrepreneurship baylor university
morris allen kuratko and brannon found that family founders nonfamily managers working in family firms and nonfamily founders experience a wide range of emotions during the first years of establishing a new business they identify differences in the emotional experiences of these three groups i extend their findings by suggesting that divergent emotional experiences may explain differences in risktaking behavior between family and nonfamily firms and between family firms furthermore i suggest that family founders early emotional experiences may affect the firms culture strategy and decisionmaking processes well beyond the startup phase baylor university
to strengthen the theoretical foundations of incentive system design for corporate entrepreneurship we develop a moderated model of new venture participation integrating financial risk and effort factors to more comprehensively understand the limits of economic utility maximization theory we make explicit the tradeoffs and opportunity costs for corporate employeeentrepreneurs we use a conjoint field experiment to collect data on decisions made by corporate employees to test how risk and effort moderate an employees decision to participate in a new corporate venture we find that these factors do interact to affect the choice to engage in corporate entrepreneurship projects baylor university
in the current study we develop an institutional embeddedness explanation of foreign initial public offering ipo performance to explain the performance differentials of these firms we investigate the effects of both home and host country institutional signals on ipo underpricing using a sample of foreign ipos listed in two different institutional environments namely the us and uk stock exchanges supporting the view that signals are institutionally embedded and that their value is not universal we find the salience of signals associated with country of origin is contingent on the institutional environment of the listing exchange baylor university
the purpose of this article was to extend existing research on opportunity identification in the social entrepreneurship literature through empirically examining this phenomenon we used an inductive theorybuilding design that surfaced patterns in social value creation across multiple case studies the patterns showed actors seeing a social need and prospecting ideas that could address it data also revealed multiple not individual actors dynamically engaged in interactions that nudged an opportunity into manifestation also data suggested complementarities to effectuation and rationaleconomic processes that are divergent theoretical approaches to the study of entrepreneurship to date baylor university
davis allen and hayes found that family members employed by the family firm reported significantly higher levels of perceived stewardship than nonfamily members we extend their research by exploring how stewardship in family firms can be further expanded throughout the firm using the theoretical perspective of leadermember exchange lmx theory particularly in family firms the leaders stewardship behaviors may establish a culture of stewardship throughout the firm the resulting reciprocal stewardship behaviors of employees can be explained through lmx mechanisms propositions are offered to explore conditions where the family firm context provides a unique opportunity for creating a culture of reciprocal stewardship baylor university
the author provides preliminary and provocative results regarding the impact of health insurance mandates on the propensity of entrepreneurs to start new organizations in keeping with a wellobserved propensity for individuals to adjust their economic calculations in anticipation of future costsbenefits the evidence suggests that when confronted with such mandates potential entrepreneurs may either abandon entrepreneurial ambitions or seek to minimize mandate costs through jurisdictional arbitrage with appreciable implications for state and national level approaches to health care health insurance provision and workers baylor university
this study aims to discover relationships using a resourcebased view of entrepreneurship and the social value creation characteristics of social entrepreneurs this study builds on existing research that commercial and social entrepreneurs share similar operational processes by providing empirical support for these relationships from a sample of acknowledged successful social entrepreneurs and by applying a resourcebased lens to the context of social entrepreneurship novel qualitative and quantitative content analysis techniques were applied to the online profiles of ashoka fellows statistically significant relationships were found among measures of partnerships financial capital innovativeness organizational structure and knowledge transferability these findings suggest that social entrepreneurs when viewed through a resourcebased lens demonstrate similar internal operational processes in utilizing resource bundles as commercial entrepreneurs baylor university
this paper proposes a semiparametric analysis for the study of the relationship between energy consumption per capita and income per capita for an international panel dataset it shows little evidence for the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for energy consumption energy consumption increases with income for a majority of countries and then stabilizes for very high income countries neither changes in energy structure nor macroeconomic cycletechnological change have significant effect on energy consumption elsevier bv
this article explores the determinants of corruption in transition economies of the postsoviet union centraleastern europe and western industrialized states we look indepth at the eastwest gap in corruption and why entrepreneurs and small business owners become engaged in corrupt deals part of the answers lie in the countryspecific formal and informal institutional makeup the likelihood of engaging in corruption is influenced by the lower efficiency of financial and legal institutions and the lack of their enforcements also viewing illegal business activities as a widespread business practice provides the rationale for entrepreneurs to justify their own corrupt activities moreover closed social networks with family friends and national bureaucrats reduce the opportunism of the contracting party of the corrupt deal thus providing breeding grounds for corruption baylor university
social venture capitalists svcs have emerged to provide a new source of funding for social entrepreneurs building on organizational identity theory we examine how the dual identity of social ventures grounded within the social and entrepreneurship sectors prompts svcs to value the resources and goals of both sectors we use policy capturing to study the decision rules of svcs finding that criteria of both sectors influenced svc assessments and entrepreneurial sector criteria were relied on most strongly in these assessments furthermore not all svcs evaluate social ventures similarly their social investment focus influences their emphasis on social and entrepreneurial sector criteria baylor university
ignoring technical and allocative inefficiencies or embedding one of them alone in a system of input demands may result in biased elasticities we consider a comprehensive model including technical inefficiency in input and output forms and allocative inefficiency and apply it to panel data from irans manufacturing sector the results show that the presence of both inefficiencies affects the computed elasticities of demand and substitution moreover in spite of current waste of energy in irans manufacturing the elimination of environmental constraints will prompt the manufacturing firms to increase the utilization of energy relative to both capital and labor elsevier bv
an experiential perspective for examining family business creation is introduced as a lived experience the family firm generates a cumulative series of interdependent events that takes on properties rooted in affect the family business is a context that enables unscripted temporal performances by founders characteristics of the venture creation experience are examined and underlying dimensions are proposed and empirically investigated building on social capital theory differences in experiences between founders of family businesses nonfamily managers and founders of nonfamily ventures are explored these differences are argued to have important implications for decision making and ongoing dynamics within the family firm baylor university
we investigate how corporate venture capitalists cvcs can rapidly attain central positions in venture capital syndication networks using data of cvc investments by us corporations between and we complement prior research which suggests that centrally positioned vcs predominantly invest together with other centrally positioned vcs while we find clear support for the social network theory arguments that prior central positions in syndication networks significantly explain future network positions of cvcs we also find a negative interaction effect between past centrality and corporate resources this finding implies that resources of cvcs can substitute for their lack of prior centrality and allow them to gain rapidly central positions in rigid vc syndication networks baylor university
here a model of minority firm expansion based on the resourcebased view the expansion barriers framework and social stratification processes illustrates the economic and social barriers faced by minority companies firm growth is impacted by industry economic structure through expansion barriers and by industry social structure through opportunity structures it is argued that industry social structure which includes discriminatory industry practices can be used to stratify firms into higher and lower performing groups by ethnicity and will have a greater impact on minority firm growth in industries with more concentrated social structures and higher wealth creation potential baylor university
many rural communities in the united states are economically depressed however while poor rural communities are geographically isolated and small they are likely to be rich in social capital we first argue that the nature of the social capital in such communities can either facilitate or constrain the development of business networks among entrepreneurs we then explain the communitylevel conditions that might increase the probability of business network effectiveness the primary opportunities that such networks can exploit and their potential spillover effects on economic development are also identified finally we provide directions for research that can contribute to better public policy decisions baylor university
we examine the impact of interorganizational imitation on new venture international entry and subsequent performance using a sample of usbased publicly held new ventures we find that new venture international entry is in part an imitative response to the internationalization of other firms in the ventures home country industry andor subsets of firms with certain traits or outcomes we also find that interorganizational imitation moderates the relationship between new venture international entry and profitability but not the relationship between new venture international entry and sales growth these findings contribute to the growing body of literature on new venture internationalization baylor university
incumbent firms facing disruptive business model innovations must decide whether to respond through inaction resistance adoption or resilience we focus on resilient responses to simultaneous perceived threat and opportunity by managers of small incumbent firms using cognitive framing arguments we argue that risk experience moderates perceptions of opportunity whereas perceived urgency moderates situation threat we test our framework in the real estate brokerage context where small incumbents face considerable challenges from disruptive business model innovations such as discount brokers analysis of data from real estate brokers broadly confirms our framework we conclude with implications of our research for small business incumbents baylor university
while the influence of form and structure on social entrepreneurship has received some attention within academe the perception of form as discrete rather than embedded in organizational history and structure as an individual dichotomous choice between simple forprofit and nonprofit alternatives has painted an incomplete picture through a rigorous analysis of case studies located within africa and latin america involving social intrapreneurship our findings suggest that cognitive network and cultural embeddedness each play an important constraining role that is even more pronounced in organizations that were historically nonprofit in form however our results also suggest a variety of decoupled structural approaches that may help mitigate such constraints baylor university
this case focuses on envirofit international a student startup venture that began in an undergraduate entrepreneurship course two engineering students and two faculty members at a land grant university in the united states designed a retrofit kit to vastly reduce emissions from dirty twostroke motorcycles which are used throughout asian cities as taxis this case presents the beginnings of the envirofit story and the issues involved in creating an entrepreneurial venture focused on triple bottom line objectives in base of pyramid markets specifically the case examines the ambiguity facing a startup as it begins to develop a technology a business model and a management team the case demonstrates the tension between planning and doing in managing the uncertainty facing a new venture baylor university
recent literature has highlighted two conflicting theories of entrepreneurship in the discovery perspective objective environmental conditions are considered to be the source of entrepreneurial opportunities and thus drivers of subsequent entrepreneurial action the creation view in contrast is based on entrepreneurial perceptions and sociocognitive enactment processes while empirical studies have separately utilized each of these perspectives few attempts have been made to integrate insights from both theories to empirically examine the interrelationships among environmental conditions entrepreneurial perceptions entrepreneurial action and outcomes in this article we explicate the roles that both objective environmental conditions and entrepreneurial perceptions of opportunity and resource availability play in the process of firm creation utilizing longitudinal data on nascent entrepreneurs we find that as hypothesized entrepreneurs opportunity perceptions mediate between objective characteristics of the environment and the entrepreneurs efforts to start a new venture contrary to our expectations we do not find a similar mediating effect for perceived resource availability these findings have important implications for further theory development in entrepreneurship as well as for practice and education in the field baylor university
why do family businesses exist what factors explain their versatility limitations and success within and across different industrial and geographic contexts we develop a transaction cost framework that addresses these questions in doing so we identify a class of assets we term generic nontradeables gnts that are firm specific but generic in application while many types of firms may possess such assets we reason that family firm governance provides relative advantages in developing sustaining and appropriating value from gnts through combinations with other types of assets we propose that these advantages as well as some concomitant disadvantages explain the versatility limitations and success of family business enterprise baylor university
as environments become more dynamic and increasingly competitive organizations must become more entrepreneurial to explain how and why an organization becomes more or less entrepreneurial over time we investigate the interrelationship between the psychology of individuals and the culture of organizations to that end we develop the notion of entrepreneurial spiralsenduring deviationamplifying loopsthat serve to link the managers mindset to his or her organizations culture and vice versa we investigate how entrepreneurial spirals start perpetuate and stop and detail the implications and insights suggested by entrepreneurial spirals for the relationship between managerial mindset and organizational culture baylor university
this article draws on theories about the internationalization process of small and mediumsized enterprises smes and feminist arguments to explain gender differences in export propensity findings are based on a largescale survey of canadian smes after controlling for sector firm and owner attributes female majorityowned firms were significantly less likely to export than firms owned by men the implications for entrepreneurship and feminist theory export policy and research are considered baylor university
many differences can be found among the existing accounting systems for tracking economywide energy efficiency trends there is a need for greater uniformity in the design and application of such systems but a formal study does not exist this paper seeks to fill some of the gaps it begins by introducing the basic concepts indicators and terminology in this study area this is followed by a review of the existing economywide energy efficiency accounting systems with a focus on the analytical framework the merit of having a precise and meaningful relationship between two basic energy indicators the energy efficiency index and the energy savings due to efficiency improvement is elaborated an accounting framework based on the lmdi decomposition technique which possesses a number of desirable properties is proposed numerical examples are presented to highlight these properties and show the differences among the various accounting frameworks several methodological and application issues are discussed and the study concludes with key findings and recommendations elsevier bv
the development of firm growth research has been notably slow in this paper we argue that a major reason for this lack of development is the impatience of researchers to prematurely address the question of how much before adequately providing answers to the question how on the basis of an extensive review of the literature we suggest how growth research can advance by changing focus to growth mode organic acquisition hybrid toward this end we provide a research agenda that helps establish the types of questions that growth researchers can ask within this new focus baylor university
stages of growth models were the most frequent theoretical approach to understanding entrepreneurial business growth from to they built on the growth imperative and developmental models of that time an analysis of the universe of such models n published in the management literature showed no consensus on basic constructs of the approach and no empirical confirmation of stages theory however by changing two propositions of stages theory a new dynamic states approach was derived the dynamic states approach has far greater explanatory power than its precursor and is compatible with leading edge research in entrepreneurship baylor university
we study how social capital induces performance spillover effects in an industry network of entrepreneurs building their own hydroelectric micropower plants most of them are farmers and novices living in rural areas there is a link between social capital and performance at firm level by expanding the level of analysis to dyads we find that entrepreneurs lacking social capital can compensate for this through cohesion with colleagues rich in social capital entrepreneurs can also benefit by mimicking the networking patterns of successful colleagues gaining access to equivalent resources developed in the niche baylor university
using bankruptcy laws as a case of formal institutions we show how formal institutions impact entrepreneurship development historically bankruptcy laws usually have been harsh recently many governments have realized that entrepreneurfriendly bankruptcy laws can not only lower exit barriers but also lower entry barriers for entrepreneurs since bankruptcy laws are not uniform around the world it is important to understand how they differ in their friendliness to entrepreneurs this article focuses on six dimensions of entrepreneurfriendliness the availability of a reorganization bankruptcy option the time spent on bankruptcy procedures the cost of bankruptcy procedures the opportunity to have a fresh start in liquidation bankruptcy the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets during reorganization bankruptcy and the opportunity for entrepreneurs and managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy in an effort to cover both developed and emerging economies and to draw on geographically diverse examples we use data from australia canada chile finland hong kong japan norway peru singapore south korea thailand the united states and other countries to illustrate these differences overall this article contributes to the institutionbased view of entrepreneurship by highlighting the important role that formal institutions such as bankruptcy laws play behind entrepreneurship development around the world baylor university
business goals in family businesses are often subsumed by family goals as a result reference performance for each family business is different this makes the popular financial performance measure of publicly traded companies profit maximization insufficient for family businesses we believe that for evaluating family businesses the family members satisfaction with firm performance is a better measure of performance in the study we identify three predictors of family members satisfaction with firm performance and test the proposed linkages on two samples of family businesses baylor university
this study utilizes data from firms in six countries to assess the impact of national culture and certain institutions that are representative of national culture on two key dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation risk taking and proactiveness eight hypotheses are developed specifying the expected relationships between four cultural dimensions and levels of risk taking and proactiveness within smes additionally two hypotheses are developed to explore betweencountry differences in the relationship between risk taking and proactiveness and a range of institutional variables uncertainty avoidance and power distance are both found to have a significant negative influence on risk taking uncertainty avoidance individualism and power distance are found to negatively influence proactive firm behaviors a number of institutional factors are also found to be significantly linked to betweencountry differences in both risk taking and proactive behaviors this research contributes to existing theories of national culture by suggesting that the various dimensions of cultural values and several of the institutions that are representative of national culture impact the willingness of entrepreneurial firms to display risk taking and proactive behaviors baylor university
institutional theory is an increasingly utilized theoretical lens for entrepreneurship research however while institutional theory has proven highly useful its use has reached a point that there is a need to establish a clearer understanding of its wideranging application to entrepreneurship research therefore we will initially review the existing entrepreneurship literature that employs institutional theory to both understand the current status of the field its current shortcomings and where we need to move in the future we then summarize and discuss the articles in this special issue and how they contribute to this process of advancing institutional theory and its application in entrepreneurship research baylor university
although base of the pyramid markets are significant sources of entrepreneurial opportunities the nature of entrepreneurship in these markets is not well understood additionally these markets remain largely underserved by multinational enterprises mnes given theoretical and practical gaps associated with these issues we integrate entrepreneurship institutional and network theories to discuss how the entrepreneurship process of mnes is negatively affected in base of the pyramid markets we then explain how partnerships with nongovernment organizations ngos can offset such negative effects due to ngos high degree of localized knowledge social embeddedness within multiple informal networks and ambidexterity in dealing with diverse stakeholder groups both economic and social benefits can result from such partnerships baylor university
empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that businesses that act with an entrepreneurial orientation enjoy superior performance our research investigates whether nonprofit religious congregations can benefit from similar initiatives we based our hypotheses on the rational choice theory of religion which was developed by social scientists to bring economic analysis to the understanding of the effects of competition among nonprofit organizations using a sample of religious congregations in five different geographical markets an entrepreneurial orientation is found to be positively associated with organizational performance a hypothesized interaction effect between environmental munificence and entrepreneurial orientation is assessed baylor university
we provide an overview of the articles and commentaries devoted to theories of family enterprise in this special issue and link them to the concept of trust trust is a governance mechanism and theoretical construct of particular relevance for family firms encapsulating some of their advantages and disadvantages trust is also linked to theoretical frameworks such as agency theory stewardship theory social capital theory and transaction cost economics that are often used in family business studies including those found in this special issue consequently we advance trust as a bridging concept to reconcile and enhance our understanding of family firms as a unique organizational form baylor university
stewardship theory has been used to explain the culture and relationships within family businesses researchers have also demonstrated that stewardship leads to superior family business performance to date few empirical analyses have examined the situational mechanisms associated with stewardship in family business this paper examines the role of the family in explaining stewardship within a family business including the role of trust value commitment and agency we find that value commitment trust and agency perceptions explain a significant portion of stewardship variance for family and nonfamily business employees we further find that family member employees perceive significantly higher value commitment trust and stewardship perceptions and lower agency perceptions in family firm leadership than nonfamily members suggesting that blood is indeed thicker than water baylor university
following kuhn this article conceptualizes social entrepreneurship as a field of action in a preparadigmatic state that currently lacks an established epistemology using approaches from neoinstitutional theory this research focuses on the microstructures of legitimation that characterize the development of social entrepreneurship in terms of its key actors discourses and emerging narrative logics this analysis suggests that the dominant discourses of social entrepreneurship represent legitimating material for resourcerich actors in a process of reflexive isomorphism returning to kuhn the article concludes by delineating a critical role for scholarly research on social entrepreneurship in terms of resolving conflicting discourses within its future paradigmatic development baylor university
current theorizations of bricolage in entrepreneurship studies require refinement and development to be used as a theoretical framework for social entrepreneurship our analysis traces bricolages conceptual underpinnings from various disciplines identifying its key constructs as making do a refusal to be constrained by limitations and improvisation although these characteristics appear to epitomize the process of creating social enterprises our research identifies three further constructs associated with social entrepreneurship social value creation stakeholder participation and persuasion using data from a qualitative study of eight uk social enterprises we apply the bricolage concept to social entrepreneurial action and propose an extended theoretical framework of social bricolage baylor university
this article reports the analysis of case studies of portfolio entrepreneurs that suggests that one of the main reasons for the formation and expansion of business groups is the need to create an entrepreneurial team which is achieved by giving minority shares in the new ventures to others mainly former employees this enhances entrepreneurs ability to grow and diversify the businesses under their control without compromising their ownership control of the overall business group the article identifies and discusses the different types of entrepreneurial teams developed by portfolio entrepreneurs joint ventures with established entrepreneurs employee involvement and intrapreneurship the latter two types were specifically interesting in studying situations where there was a dominant entrepreneur and associate entrepreneurs the article enhances the theoretical and empirical understanding of how growth is achieved in the small firms sector through business group formation and sheds insights on how entrepreneurial team dynamics operate in multiple business contexts baylor university
dominant logic is the manner in which firms conceptualize and make critical resourceallocation decisions and over time develop mental maps business models and processes that become organizational recipes this study compares and contrasts the dominant logic of polish entrepreneurial firms we find evidence that a dominant logic characterized by external orientation proactiveness and simplicity of routines significantly influences the performance of entrepreneurial firms in this emerging economy these dominant logic characteristics of high performers serve as a key intangible resource in transition economies that are characterized by the absence of strong institutions and resource constraints future research in this critical domain should include how dominant logic needs in transition economies evolve over time as the institutional environment matures and market mechanisms become more solidified baylor university
this article explores the rationale of syndications of institutional venture capital investors when they fund startups there is an implicit labor division between institutional venture capital investors in which pure venture capital firms are in charge of converting investment uncertainty into risk by funding the seed stage of startups the other investors invest in the following stages to sustain the startups development relationships between investors are also handled following informal rules exchanges between institutional venture capital investors are based on a reciprocity that follows the informal principles of the gift exchange theory baylor university
this paper studies the effect of the introduction of governmentprovided internet technology to rural communities internet communities on regional entrepreneurship entrepreneurship increases among larger internet communities as the internet spurs entrepreneurial activities by enabling agglomeration across areas that have a preexisting cluster of real entrepreneurial activities there is however a decrease in entrepreneurship among smaller and more geographically remote internet communities as the internet facilitates the consumption of items and services not produced within such smaller communities overall the key finding is that virtual entrepreneurial clusters are not independent of real entrepreneurial clusters baylor university
gedajlovic and carneys application of transaction cost economics tce thinking to the family business builds on tces concept of asset specificity our analysis augments this application we focus on tces behavioral assumptions which act as drivers of failed human commitments we show that both the exposure and response to bounded rationality and bounded reliability challenges may be different in family firms versus chandlerian hierarchies and introduce the new concept of familybased human asset specificity baylor university
economies in transition such as russias are among the worlds fastest growing entrepreneurial firms in an environment like russias face rapid and dramatic shifts in the institutional environment these shifts represent significant challenges to entrepreneurial firms as they seek not only to survive but also to prosper in that environment by rapidly coevolving with institutional changes prior research has focused on institutional change and its impact in developed economies but the rate of evolution of institutions in transition economies tends to be faster and less predictable this article reports a longitudinal study of high technology entrepreneurial firms in russia employing a grounded theory methodology to understand how entrepreneurial ventures coevolve with rapid institutional changes and still manage to prosper baylor university
this study summarizes and analyzes average statistical power and effect sizes in empirical entrepreneurship research results show that statistical power was higher than expected and was particularly high in studies employing archival measures statistical power has also increased over time effect sizes were higher than expected a finding that remained consistent for different levels of analysis and across multiple subdomains we discuss these findings compare them to related disciplines and draw implications for the design of future studies baylor university
researchers claim that social entrepreneurship represents a new phenomenon within the social sector their studies often distinguish social entrepreneurs according to their emphasis on tracking and measuring their performance by applying sense making theory to three case studies of funding relationships within the social sector this study finds that organizations within the social sector employ performance measurement not just as a means of accountability but also as a tool for making sense of social entrepreneurship as an organizational identity as such the article refocuses scholarly attention on social entrepreneurship as a socially constructed phenomenon baylor university
understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research because ceo compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects ceo compensation prior research has painted familymember ceos as stewards who accept lower compensation based on agency theory we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces familymember ceos compensation thus familymember ceos accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board in comparison with ceos at nonfamily firms we find that familymember ceo compensation is lower when multiple family members are involved but higher when the ceo is the lone family member baylor university
this case focuses on the decisions confronting marc van der bilt and his family at the age of marc had been a franchisee of the dutch da drugstore chain for years and had always planned to remain one until his retirement in the spring of however a change of management at the da headquarters sparked major strategic changes to the da chain that placed marc and his family in a difficult position they must decide on the future of their family business should they go along with their franchisors new plans or not baylor university
in this study we investigate the relationship between institutional elements of the social environment and entrepreneurial cognitions which lead to the individuals venture creation decision employing a sample of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs from eight countries we examine the extent to which institutions influence venture creation decisions where entrepreneurial expert scripts act as a mediator results show that various institutional elements such as legal and financial systems affect venture arrangements and willingness scripts venture arrangements scripts in turn have the most significant impact on an individuals venture creation decision baylor university
the current growth literature has stalled over which measures to use in empirical studies causing a fragmented theory base this paper claims that there is a third issue that further curbs efforts in developing a better understanding of business growth based on a thorough literature review a quantitative and a qualitative study we find that academic scholars and entrepreneurs do not talk about the same thing when they say business growth for practitioners growth is a more complex phenomenonwith a strong emphasis on internal developmentwhich differs from the simplified conceptualization of growth used in empirical studies baylor university
even though there has been sustained interest in growth for almost years relatively little is known about this phenomenon and much confusion and misunderstanding surrounds it based on a literature review and the articles in this special issue we make three recommendations that we believe will allow theory to advance and be applicable in practice first that discourse between key stakeholders is encouraged in order to achieve greater understanding second that focus is placed on growth as a process rather than as a change in amount third that knowledge production requires inclusivity and pluralism in research perspectives and approaches baylor university
transition economies are often characterized by underdeveloped formal institutions often resulting in an unstable environment and creating a void usually filled by informal ones entrepreneurs in transition environments thus face more uncertainty and risk than those in more developed economies this article examines the relationship of institutions and entrepreneurship in russia and china in the context of institutional theory by analyzing private property as a formal institution as well as trust and blat guanxi as informal institutions this article thus contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship and institutional theory by focusing on these topics in transition economies and by emphasizing how their relationship differs from that in developed economies we conclude that full convergence toward entrepreneurs reliance on formal institutions may not readily occur in countries like russia and china due to the embeddedness of informal institutions instead such countries and their entrepreneurs may develop unique balances between informal and formal institutions that better fit their circumstances implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurship in such environments are also offered baylor university
although entrepreneurship research on networks has studied issues pertaining to network content governance and structure we believe it requires a greater understanding of network processes in this paper we review how the entrepreneurship literature interprets and applies the concept of process to the study of networks this allows us to identify areas for future investigation our work is also informed by social network theory and research on dyadic interactions in business networks the paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework for conceptualizing and studying the various processes associated with network development baylor university
in this paper we use the locally flexible translog functional form to investigate the demand for energy and interfuel substitution in the united states and to provide a comparison of our results with most of the existing empirical energy demand literature motivated by the widespread practice of ignoring theoretical regularity we follow barnetts suggestions and estimate the model subject to theoretical regularity using methods developed by diewert and wales and ryan and wales in an attempt to produce inference consistent with neoclassical microeconomic theory moreover we use the most recent data published by the us energy information administration eia and in addition to investigating interfuel substitution possibilities in total us energy demand we follow serletis et al and also examine interfuel substitution possibilities in energy demand by sector moreover we test for weak separability with the objective of discovering the structure of the functional form in total energy demand as well as energy demand by sector elsevier bv

this study proposes an index for measuring environmentally sensitive productivity growth which appropriately considers the nature of technical change the rationale of this methodology is to exclude a spurious technical regress from the macroeconomic perspective in order to incorporate this in developing the index a directional distance function and the concept of the successive sequential production possibility set are combined with this combination the conventional malmquistluenberger productivity index is modified to give the sequential malmquistluenberger productivity index this index is employed in measuring environmentally sensitive productivity growth and its decomposed components of oecd countries for the period we distinguish two main empirical findings first even though the components of the conventional malmquistluenberger productivity index and the proposed index are different the trends of rates of average productivity growth are similar second unlike in previous studies the efficiency change is the main contributor to the earlier study period whereas the effect of technical change has prevailed over time elsevier bv
corn ethanol plants have been criticized for a number of reasons in recent years this paper provides another ground for criticizing these plants historical corn and gasoline prices are uncorrelated but widespread adoption of corn ethanol production might reasonably lead to future correlation between these prices we present a real options like valuation of an ethanol plant as a spark spread between the corn price and the gasoline price this analysis shows that the value of an ethanol plant monotonically decreases with increasing correlation and the optimal production schedule greatly depends on the correlation even relatively small new correlations can result in a significant proportional value decrease a correlation between corn and gasoline causes ethanol plants to lose of their value the limiting case of full correlation would lead to a value loss elsevier bv
this paper examines how pretax petrol and diesel prices in new zealand respond to changes in crude oil prices using an asymmetric error correction model our results show that oil companies adjust diesel prices upwards faster than they adjust them downwards and the difference is statistically significant however we find no statistical evidence for an asymmetry in the adjustment of petrol prices even though the magnitude of estimated coefficients suggests a faster response to rising prices as diesel pricing is not as competitive as petrol pricing calls for further government actions and monitoring of the oil market may be justified our findings also have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy as the passthrough of crude oil price changes can affect costpush inflation elsevier bv
this paper applies an aggregate production function to examine the dynamic linkages among energy consumption capital stock and real income real gdp per capita in g counties we employ the toda and yamamoto granger causality test the generalized impulse response approach and variance decompositions in a multivariate setting to uncover the extent and the magnitude of the relationship among variables our empirical results find evidence of a unidirectional relationship running from energy consumption to real income in canada italy and the uk indicating that energy conservation may hinder economic growth in the three countries furthermore the causality relationship appears to be unidirectional but reversed for france and japan implying that energy conservation in both countries may still be viable but without being detrimental to economic growth as to germany and the us there is no causality between the variables which demonstrates the neutrality hypothesis and in such a case economic growth will not affect energy use we further see that the impact of capital stock is relatively higher compared with that of energy consumption transitory initial impacts of innovations in energy consumption on capital stock and real income are observed elsevier bv
this study investigates the shortrun dynamics and longrun equilibrium relationship between residential electricity demand and factors influencing demand per capita income price of electricity price of kerosene oil and price of liquefied petroleum gas using annual data for sri lanka for the period the study uses unit root cointegration and errorcorrection models the longrun demand elasticities of income own price and price of kerosene oil substitute were estimated to be and respectively the shortrun elasticities for the same variables were estimated to be and respectively liquefied petroleum lp gas is a substitute for electricity only in the shortrun with an elasticity of the main findings of the paper support the following increasing the price of electricity is not the most effective tool to reduce electricity consumption existing subsidies on electricity consumption can be removed without reducing government revenue the longrun income elasticity of demand shows that any future increase in household incomes is likely to significantly increase the demand for electricity and any power generation plans which consider only current per capita consumption and population growth should be revised taking into account the potential future income increases in order to avoid power shortages in the country elsevier bv
the high volatility of electricity markets gives producers and retailers an incentive to hedge their exposure to electricity prices by buying and selling derivatives this paper studies how welfare and investment incentives are affected when an increasing number of derivatives are introduced it develops an equilibrium model of the electricity market with risk averse firms and a set of traded financial products more specifically a forward contract and an increasing number of options we first show that aggregate welfare the sum of individual firms utility increases with the number of derivatives offered although most of the benefits are captured with one to three options secondly power plant investments typically increase because additional derivatives enable better hedging of investments however the availability of derivatives sometimes leads to crowdingout of physical investments because firms limited risktaking capabilities are being used to speculate on financial markets finally we illustrate that players basing their investment decisions on riskfree probabilities inferred from market prices may significantly overinvest when markets are not sufficiently complete elsevier bv
fuel taxes have returned to centre stage as a potential policy instrument for greenhouse gas abatement on the basis of some studies in developed countries critics have complained that a fuel tax would be regressive this paper uses data from a representative household survey covering more than thousand indian households to examine this claim it finds that a fuel tax would be progressive as would a carbon tax using an inputoutput approach it is found that the progressivity results holds good even when one considers indirect consumption of fuel through its use as an intermediate input sensitivity checks allowing for differing price elasticities of demand between rich and poor confirm this result for most of fuels a tax on kerosene is the only fuel tax that is regressive in all situations elsevier bv

an electric energy producer participates in futures markets in the hope of hedging the risk of trading in the pool however this producer is required to supply the energy associated with all its signed forward contracts even if some of its units are forced out due to unexpected failures in this case the producer must purchase some of the energy needed to meet its futures market commitments in the pool which may result in high losses if the pool prices happen to be higher than the forward contract prices to mitigate these losses the producer can take out insurance against the forced outages of its units using a stochastic programming model this paper analyzes the convenience of signing an insurance against unit failure by an electric energy producer and its impact on forward contracting decisions results from a realistic case study are provided and analyzed elsevier bv

previous studies have found evidence of asymmetric price adjustment in us retail gasoline prices in that gasoline prices rise more rapidly in response to a cost increase than fall in response to a cost decrease by estimating a threshold cointegration model that allows for multiple regimes i am able to test how sensitive this result is to outlying observations in contrast to previous studies i find little evidence of asymmetry for the vast majority of observations and that the asymmetry is being driven by a small number of outlying observations elsevier bv
although electricity is crucial to many activities in developed societies guaranteeing a maximum reliability of supply to endusers is extremely costly this situation gives rise to a tradeoff between the costs and benefits of reliability the dutch government has responded to this tradeoff by changing the rule stipulating that electricity networks must be able to maintain supply even if one component fails known as the n rule even in maintenance situations this rule was changed by adding the phrase unless the costs exceed the benefits we have developed a costbenefit framework for the implementation and application of this new rule the framework requires input on failure probability the cost of supply interruptions to endusers and the cost of investments a case study of the dutch grid shows that the method is indeed practicable and that it is highly unlikely that n during maintenance will enhance welfare in the netherlands therefore including the limitation unless the costs exceed the benefits in the rule has been a sensible policy for the netherlands and would also be a sensible policy for other countries elsevier bv
in this article we use half hourly spot electricity prices and load data for the national electricity market nem of australia for the period from december to june to test for episodic nonlinearity in the dynamics governing daily and weekly cycles in load and spot price time series data we apply the portmanteau correlation bicorrelation and tricorrelation tests introduced in hinich to the time series of half hourly spot prices and load demand from to using a fortran program we find the presence of significant third and fourthorder nonlinear serial dependence in the weekly load and spot price data in particular but to a much more marginal extent in the daily data elsevier bv
for oil related investment appraisal an accurate description of the evolving uncertainty in the oil price is essential for example when using real option theory to value an investment a density function for the future price of oil is central to the option valuation the literature on oil pricing offers two views the arbitrage pricing theory literature for oil suggests geometric brownian motion and mean reversion models empirically driven literature suggests armagarch models in addition to reflecting the volatility of the market the density function of future prices should also incorporate the uncertainty due to price jumps a common occurrence in the oil market in this study the accuracy of density forecasts for up to a year ahead is the major criterion for a comparison of a range of models of oil price behaviour both those proposed in the literature and following from data analysis the kullbach leibler information criterion is used to measure the accuracy of density forecasts using two crude oil price series brent and west texas intermediate wti representing the us market we demonstrate that accurate density forecasts are achievable for up to nearly two years ahead using a mixture of two gaussians innovation processes with garch and no mean reversion elsevier bv
two players with common interests exchange information to make a decision but they fear scrutiny their unencrypted communications will be observed by another agent with different interests who can object to their decision we show how the players can implement their ideal decision rule using a backandforth conversation such a subversive conversation reveals enough information for the players to determine their best decision but not enough information for the observer to determine whether the decision was against his interest our results show how conversations can maintain deniability even in the face of leaks hacks and other public exposures the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper investigates social learning in sequential voting systems in the econometric model candidates experience momentum effects when their performance in early states exceeds expectations the empirical application uses daily polling data from the presidential primary we find that kerry benefited from surprising wins in early states and took votes away from dean owing to these momentum effects early voters had up to five times the influence of late voters in the selection of candidates and this helps to explain the distribution of advertising expenditures finally we use the estimated model to conduct two counterfactual experiments by the university of chicago
we analyze the optimal dynamic policy of an antitrust authority toward horizontal mergers when merger proposals are endogenous and occur over time approving a currently proposed merger may affect the profitability and welfare effects of potential future mergers whose characteristics may not yet be known we identify conditions under which discounted expected consumer surplus is maximized by using a completely myopic merger review policy that approves a merger if and only if it does not lower consumer surplus given the current market structure we also discuss a number of extensions as well as factors that undermine the optimality of myopic merger review policies by the university of chicago
this paper studies whether labor scarcity encourages technological advances that is technology adoption or innovation for example as claimed by habakkuk in the context of nineteenthcentury united states i define technology as strongly labor saving if technological advances reduce the marginal product of labor and as strongly labor complementary if they increase it i show that labor scarcity encourages technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving and will discourage them if technology is strongly labor complementary i also show that technology can be strongly labor saving in plausible environments but not in many canonical macroeconomic models by the university of chicago
this paper develops a novel theory of marketing costs within a trade model with product differentiation and heterogeneity in firm productivities a firm enters a market if it is profitable to incur the marginal cost to reach a single consumer it then faces an increasing marginal penetration cost to access additional consumers the model therefore can reconcile the observed positive relationship between entry and market size with the existence of many small exporters in each exporting market comparative statics of trade liberalization predict a large increase in trade for goods with positive but low volumes of previous trade by the university of chicago
we study the effect of releasing public information about productivity or monetary shocks using a microfounded macroeconomic model in which agents learn from the distribution of nominal prices while a public release has the direct beneficial effect of providing new information it also has the indirect adverse effect of reducing the informational efficiency of the price system we show that the negative indirect effect can dominate thus the public information release may increase uncertainty about the monetary shock and reduce welfare we find that the optimal communication policy is always to release either all or none of the information by the university of chicago

the introduction and diffusion of personal computers are widely viewed as a technological revolution using us metropolitan arealevel panel data this paper asks whether links between pc adoption educational attainment and the return to skill conform to a model of technological revolutions in which the speed and extent of adoption are endogenous the model implies that cities will adjust differently to the arrival of a more skillintensive means of production with the returns to skill increasing most where skill is abundant and its return is low we show that the crosscity data fit many of the predictions of the model during the period the pc diffusion era by the university of chicago
a sender randomly draws a prospect characterized by its profitability to the sender and its relevance to a receiver the receiver observes only a signal provided by the sender and accepts the prospect if his bayesian inference about the prospects relevance exceeds his opportunity cost the senders profits are typically maximized by partial information disclosure whereby the receiver is induced to accept less relevant but more profitable prospects switches by pooling them with more relevant but less profitable ones baits extensions include maximizing a weighted sum of sender profits and receiver surplus and allowing the sender to use monetary incentives by the university of chicago

the favoritelong shot bias describes the longstanding empirical regularity that betting odds provide biased estimates of the probability of a horse winning long shots are overbet whereas favorites are underbet neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers who overbet long shots because of risklove the competing behavioral explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities we provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these competing theories by assessing whether the models that explain gamblers choices in one part of their choice set betting to win can also rationalize decisions over a wider choice set including compound bets in the exacta quinella or trifecta pools using a new largescale data set ideally suited to implement these tests we find evidence in favor of the view that misperceptions of probability drive the favoritelong shot bias as suggested by prospect theory by the university of chicago all rights reserved

in primary and secondary education measures of teacher quality are often based on contemporaneous student performance on standardized achievement tests in the postsecondary environment scores on student evaluations of professors are typically used to measure teaching quality we possess unique data that allow us to measure relative student performance in mandatory followon classes we compare metrics that capture these three different notions of instructional quality and present evidence that professors who excel at promoting contemporaneous student achievement teach in ways that improve their student evaluations but harm the followon achievement of their students in more advanced classes copyright by the university of chicago
using data compiled from concentrated residential urban revitalization programs implemented in richmond virginia between and we study residential externalities we estimate that housing externalities decrease by half approximately every feet on average land prices in neighborhoods targeted for revitalization rose by percent at an annual rate above those in a control neighborhood these increases translate into land value gains of between and per dollar invested in the program over a year period we provide a simple theory that helps us estimate and interpret these effects in terms of the parameters of the model copyright by the university of chicago
we present a general equilibrium model of the response of firms decisions to operate innovate and engage in international trade to a change in the marginal cost of international trade we find that although a change in trade costs can have a substantial impact on heterogeneous firms exit export and process innovation decisions the impact of changes in these decisions on welfare is largely offset by the response of product innovation our results suggest that microeconomic evidence on firms responses to changes in international trade costs may not be informative about the implications of changes in these trade costs for aggregate welfare copyright by the university of chicago

global current account imbalances have recently been singled out by many as a key factor contributing to the global financial crisis current account surpluses in several emerging market economies are said to have put significant downward pressure on world interest rates thereby fueling a credit boom and risk taking in major advanced economies with current account deficits the excess saving view we argue that this perspective on global imbalances bears reconsideration we highlight two conceptual problems i explaining market interest rates through the savinginvestment framework and ii drawing inferences about a countrys crossborder financing activity based on observations of net capital flows we trace the shortcomings of this perspective to a failure to consider the distinguishing characteristics of a monetary credit economy we conjecture that the main macroeconomic cause of the financial crisis was not excess saving but the excess elasticity of the international monetary and financial system the authors asian economic policy review japan center for economic research

we attempt to explain the china puzzle the coexistence of accelerating economic growth and a worsening growth outlook the root cause lies in chinas unique liberalization approach that is the combination of a complete liberalization of product markets and continued distortions in factor markets repressed costs of labor capital land and resources artificially raise the profits of production increase the returns to investment and improve the international competitiveness of chinese products the asymmetric liberalization approach not only promoted economic growth but also caused structural risks it also contributed to global imbalances as well as regional integration therefore future reform policies should focus on the liberalization of the factor markets and the elimination of cost distortions the author asian economic policy review japan center for economic research

there was a significant and widening ruralurban gap during the economic boom in vietnam in the s using an econometric decomposition we find that differences in individual characteristics such as education ethnicity and age are the primary explanation for this widening gap whereas differences in the returns to these characteristics are the primary explanation for the increase in the gap at higher percentiles we then argue that government investment policies and the manipulation of price incentives were important factors behind the gap in particular we argue that government policies created some benefit to urban dwellers at the expense of rural areas lending support to liptons urbanbias hypothesis which states that government under strong political pressure from the urban population directs resources from rural to urban areas without consideration of efficiency or equity the authors journal compilation east asian economic association and blackwell publishing ltd

the february elections mark a watershed in israeli politics and highlight an increasingly rightward drift in israeli politics labour had its worst ever result the violent intifada shattered belief that negotiations with the palestinians could ever be successful and the security barrier seemed increasingly necessary if israel was to remain both jewish and democratic the coalition government constructed by binyamin netanyahu was carefully balanced and looks durable the more so as somewhat surprisingly it includes labour and barak as defence minister kadima could face some hard days in opposition unless netanyahu falls out with washington or the coalition collapses copyright the royal society for asian affairs
why does the postindependence history of democracy in pakistan contrast so sharply with that of india the article suggests that there were historical factors to do with the vision of pakistan as a muslim state differential inheritances at partition with india inheriting the colonial states unitary centre the challenge of managing a diverse population separated by thousands of miles etc in addition the security problems with india amplified the role of the army and weakened the civilian politicians many of whom were hardly democrats to start with there were other external factors principally us policy which saw pakistan in a global geopolitical context copyright the royal society for asian affairs
the article describes the batang kali incident in which a number of chinese workers were shot dead by the british army in circumstances which have never been satisfactorily explained the author who published a history of the malayan emergency some years ago sets the incident in the wider context of british policy in the somewhat confused early months of the emergency he then chronicles the subsequent attempts to reexamine events he then examines various suggestions that british policy was in general one of deliberate counterterror and concludes that the available evidence does not really substantiate this charge copyright the royal society for asian affairs
this paper contributes to the research on regional economic responses to monetary policy shocks in two ways first rather than just model the canadian economy at the national level we examine the impact of monetary policy shocks across five separate canadian regions the second extension of the literature is our focus upon estimating the impact from both canadian and u s monetary policy shocks upon regional canadian economic activity the findings are broadly consistent with results from previous research modeling the national canadian economy but noteworthy regional differences are observed eastern canadian regions defined as ontario on quebec qu and atlantic at exhibit greater sensitivity to canadian monetary policy shocks than do western canadian regions we also find that u s monetary policy shocks have a discernable impact on canadian regional economic activity but the impact varies across regions for the three eastern canadian regions on qu and at there is a significant impact upon regional economic activity from a u s monetary policy shock but not for the two western canadian regions prairie pr and west we moreover the impact on on qu and at from a fed funds shock is quite similar to the impact from a shock to the canadian bank rate international atlantic economic society
much recent theoretical and empirical research has focused on the relationship between income distribution and economic growth the fiscal policy approach argues that inequality is linked to pressure for redistributionary taxation leading to low capital investment and therefore growth empirical analyses are consonant with this view in that the longrun relationship between inequality and growth is negative however several empirical inconsistencies with the fiscal policy approach do emerge a there exists a shortrun positive relationship between income inequality and growth and b the relationship between inequality and taxation is mixed at best this paper presents a simple theoretical model that reconciles the intuitively appealing fiscal policy approach with the empirical findings international atlantic economic society
governmental stabilization policies take account of the underlying risk aversion of its voters a utility function for the government is defined one which includes variances of national income changes with respect to its policy instrumentshere the budget variable the bond rate of interest and the currencyexchange rate the consequence of this for the optimal set of policies is a target level of national income less than what a riskneutral government aims at this applies to an open economy when this is a keycurrency country as it need attend to balanceofpayments effects only insofar as they affect national income the nonkeycurrency country by contrast must take account directly of balanceofpayments effects and their variance so it reaches a lower level of utility than the keycurrency country international atlantic economic society
applied work in price discrimination often treats demand curves among multiple market segments as algebraically additive yet the welfare effects of multimarket third degree price discrimination depend on how the demand segments are added treating demands as geometrically additive yields the well known result that discrimination absent an increase in production diminishes marshallian surplus but if demands are treated as algebraically additive then discrimination increases welfare over uniform pricing quantity is identical in the three cases so the effect is not due to market opening nor is the effect due to scale economies since marginal cost is assumed constant profit is always greater under discrimination so the effect is due to distributional changes in consumer surplus the model is restricted to linear demands and constant marginal cost but can be generalized for future work and policy analysis international atlantic economic society
the distribution of industries is studied in a general equilibrium model in which firms producing manufactured products engage in oligopolistic competition the agricultural product is produced by land and labor and there is intersectoral labor mobility between the agricultural sector and the manufacturing sector results are derived analytically when worker units are divisible concentration of all workers in one region is not stable the role of land in the production of the agricultural product is important in affecting the distribution of industries international atlantic economic society
this paper develops a political economy model which determines the conditions of cycles in environmental regulation it analyzes the impact of both interest groups and voters who have biased political beliefs such biased beliefs are the result of the influence of activist interest groups that strategically use the beliefs formation process among ignorant voters cascade effect the cascade effect biases the perception of the efficiency of regulatory instruments and affects the behavior of the politician our model seems particularly relevant to explain the evolution of environmental policies which are characterized by scientific controversies such as climate change policies the high media coverage of climate issues as well as persistent debates among experts is a favorable context for the influence of activist interest groups that use the publics cognitive biases international atlantic economic society
this paper analyzes the role that wellintentioned policies contributed to the crisis and increased its severity it also examines the principalagent problems in the public sector that enabled many of the principalagent problems in the private sector often blamed for the crisis the legacy of the crisis is a massive series of bailouts by public authorities in europe and the united states that risked the equivalent of nearly onefifth of world gdp in taxpayer funds this moral hazard will lead to deeper and more frequent crises unless countered by a new approach to regulation that places greater emphasis on market discipline by creditors and counterparties international atlantic economic society
official definitions of systemic risk leave out the role of government officials in generating it policymakers support of creative forms of risktaking and their proclivity for absorbing losses in crisis situations encourage opportunistic firms to foster and exploit incentive conflicts within the supervisory sector to restore faith in the diligence competence and integrity of officials responsible for managing the financial safety net reforms need to rework incentives in the government and financial sectors the goal should be to align the incentives of private risk managers accountants creditrating firms and government supervisors with those of ordinary taxpayers this article describes a series of complementary ways of advancing toward this goal the most important steps would be to measure regulatory performance in terms of its effect on the loss exposures that the safety net passes through to taxpayers and to require institutions that benefit from the net to produce information that would support this effort this entails estimating the explicit and implicit safetynet benefits individual institutions receive and issuing extended liability securities whose prices would improve the accuracy of these estimates international atlantic economic society

an important infrastructure policy issue for rapidly growing cities in developing countries is how to raise fiscal revenues to finance basic services in a fair and efficient manner this requires estimates of the potential benefits or positive welfare effects that may follow from improved infrastructure in this paper we take advantage ofa unique georeferenced household survey to carry out a hedonic analysis ofhousing values that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers we use this to derive an estimate ofthe value ofimproved access to water in the indian city of bangalore the findings suggest that by limiting the focus to individual or private benefits only we may underestimate the overall social welfare from investing in service supply we further demonstrate how spatially explicit policy simulations based on these estimates provide insight into the total effects oftargeted interventions regional studies association
new economic geography presents increasing returns to agglomeration as a central explanation for concentration of economic activity the estimation of the size of these effects remains however a standing issue in the field the focus of this study is to investigate the presence of increasing returns to agglomeration in the spatial structure of wages in france using the methodology developed by fingleton and initially used in the uk the central finding is the statistically significant presence of such returns to density for france as was the case for the uk in the original study compared to fingletons original work it is shown that returns to density play a larger role in explaining french labour productivity while commuting plays a smaller role than in the uk regional studies association
kelejian introduces a jtype test for the situation in which a null linear regression model model is to be tested against one or more rival nonnested alternatives model modelg where typically the competing models possess endogenous spatial lags and spatially autoregressive error processes concentrating on the case g in this paper we examine the finite sample properties of a spatial j statistic that is asymptotically under the null and an alternative version that is conjectured to be approximately both introduced by kelejian we demonstrate numerically that the tests are excessively liberal in some leading cases and conservative in others using the relevant chisquare asymptotic approximations and explore how far this may be corrected using a simple bootstrap resampling method regional studies association

spatial microsimulation models typically match census of population data with survey data in order to simulate synthetic populations of individuals and households within smallscale geographic areas for most spatial microsimulation applications this level of spatial precision is satisfactory for others more precise information on the location of simulated units may be required to this end this paper develops a continuous space representation of a simulated population it presents a statistical matching approach for assigning simulated households from a spatial microsimulation model to unique spatiallyreferenced residential locations the allocation is based on a random assignment after splitting the simulated households into two groups those predicted to reside in apartments and those predicted to reside in houses the resulting geohouseholds have a range of potential applications in economic and spatial analysis regional studies association
this paper considers a model of spatial allocation of investment capital under uncertainty we demonstrate that the spatial concentration of economic activity depends upon properties of risk preferences deeper than risk aversion the degree of socalled relative prudence unambiguously decides whether or not the diversification of income risk favours the geographic dispersion of economic activity in our framework we relate risk diversification with economic integration then there exists risk preferences so that spatial concentration of industry and capital is not affected by the degree of economic integration or segmentation of the regions we also study the impact of net return regressibility upon spatial allocation regional studies association
the returns of house price indices for the uk regions are modelled using time series processes including conditional variances the first conclusion is that the uk follows the usa with some regions displaying timevarying variances and others with constant variances secondly there is limited evidence of an asymmetric component in six of the seven regions displaying autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity thirdly the results suggest that there are three distinct housing markets in the uk based on common structures within their mean and variance processes and that south west england is the region driving the other timevarying variances regional studies association

two aspects of new economic geography models are often singled out for criticism especially by geographers the treatment of geography typically as a pregiven fixed and highly idealized abstract geometric space and the treatment of history typically as logical time the movement to equilibrium in a models solution space rather than real history in this paper we examine the basis for these criticisms and explore how far and in what ways neg models might be made more credible with respect to their representation ofgeography and history and particularly whether and to what extent the work of geographers themselves provides some insights in this regard we argue that the conceptualization of space and time is in fact a challenge for both neg theorists and economic geographers and that notwithstanding their ontological and epistemological differences both groups would benefit from an interchange of ideas on this front regional studies association
while estimation methods for dynamic panel data and spatial econometric models are standard in economic literature there has been a relatively recent development in methods which include spatial considerations in dynamic panel data models this paper proposes two estimation strategies for spatial dynamic panel data models using the generalized method of moments gmm the first is to extend the moment restrictions of arellano and bonds estimator to a spatial autoregressive dynamic panel the second allows for spatial dependence in the error process the empirical application focuses on european regional growth over a year period we find empirical evidence of conditional convergence which is significantly affected by spatial disparities regional studies association

this paper analyzes partial identification of parameters that measure a distributions spread for example the variance gini coefficient entropy or interquartile range the core results are tight twodimensional identification regions for the expectation and variance the median and interquartile ratio and many other combinations of parameters they are developed for numerous identification settings including but not limited to cases where one can bound either the relevant cumulative distribution function or the relevant probability measure applications include missing data interval data short versus long regressions contaminated data and certain forms of sensitivity analysis the application to missing data is worked out in some detail including closedform worstcase bounds on some parameters as well as improved bounds that rely on nonparametric restrictions on selection effects a brief empirical application to bounds on inequality measures is provided the bounds are very easy to compute the ideas underlying them are explained in detail and should be readily extended to even more settings than are explicitly discussed jrg stoye

commonly used frictional models of the labor market imply that changes in frictions have large effects on steady state employment and unemployment we use a model that features both frictions and an operative labor supply margin to examine the robustness of this feature to the inclusion of an empirically reasonable labor supply channel the response of unemployment to changes in frictions is similar in both models but the labor supply response present in our model greatly attenuates the effects of frictions on steady state employment relative to the simplest matching model and two common extensions we also find that the presence of empirically plausible frictions has virtually no impact on the response of aggregate employment to taxes per krusell toshihiko mukoyama richard rogerson and ayegl ahin
research on collective provision of private goods has focused on distributional considerations this paper studies a class of problems of decision under uncertainty in which an efficiency argument for collective choice emerges from the mathematics of aggregating individual payoffs consider decision making when each member of a population has the same objective function which depends on an unknown state of nature if agents knew the state of nature they would make the same decision however they may have different beliefs or may use different decision criteria to cope with their incomplete knowledge hence they may choose different actions even though they share the same objective let the set of feasible actions be convex and the objective function be concave in actions for all states of nature then jensens inequality implies that consensus choice of the mean privately chosen action yields a larger mean payoff than does individualistic decision making in all states of nature if payoffs are transferable the mean payoff from consensus choice may be allocated to pareto dominate individualistic decision making i develop these ideas i also use jensens inequality to show that a planner with the power to assign actions to the members of the population should not diversify finally i give a version of the collectivechoice result that holds with consensus choice of the median rather than mean action charles f manski
this paper explores the properties of expected value functions in dynamic discrete choice models the continuity with respect to state variables and parameters and the differentiability with respect to state variables are established under fairly general conditions the differentiability with respect to parameters is proved when some state variables do not affect the state transition probabilities and thus the expected value functions it is shown that such variables are needed so as to apply the implicit function theorem used in the proof the results are of particular relevance to estimable dynamic discrete choice models andriy norets

influenced by the success of emission trading in the us for sulphur dioxide so some economists have argued for an upstream economywide capandtrade scheme as the primary tool for achieving the required reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions this paper addresses that argument and concludes that capandtrade will need to be accompanied by complementary regulatory measures while it is a necessary component in a climate mitigation programme it is unlikely to be sufficient by itself to accomplish the desired emission reductions the paper reviews the evidence on how so emissions were reduced and the extent to which actual emission trading was responsible for the reduction as opposed to other innovations it also identifies differences between the past regulation of so and other air pollutants and the challenges presented by the regulation of ghg emissions what actually happened in the us with so emission trading deviated in several significant respects from what would be predicted based on the conventional theoretical analysis while there was a dramatic reduction in so emissions it occurred because of several factors some of which are unlikely to apply for ghg emissions and others of which argue for an activist regulatory policy by the government as a complement to the functioning of an emissions market for ghgs the author published by oxford university press

there is an increasing demand for putting a shadow price on the environment to guide public policy and incentivize private behaviour in practice setting that price can be extremely difficult as uncertainties abound there is often uncertainty not just about individual parameters but about the structure of the problem and how to model it a further complication is the secondbest nature of real environmental policymaking in this paper we propose some practical steps for setting prices in the face of these difficulties drawing on the example of climate change we consider how to determine the overall target for environmental protection how to set shadow prices to deliver that target and how we can learn from the performance of policies to revise targets and prices perhaps most significantly we suggest that estimates of the marginal cost of environmental protection rather than the marginal benefit will often provide the more consistent and robust prices for achieving targets the authors published by oxford university press
we assess fiscal policy from the perspective of fairness between generations and the relationship between this and national saving in the context where the united kingdom is one of the lowest saving of all the oecd economies crosssection and pooled data suggest that governments are in a position to influence national saving and we set out a simple overlapping generation model to show the effects of national debt of payasyoubenefit systems and of legacies and movements to land prices as means of effecting transfers between generations having shown that governments can influence the distribution of resources between generations we then discuss three notions of fairness between generations i that each cohort should pay its own way ii that a social planner should reallocate resources between generations to achieve an intertemporal optimum and iii that resources should be reallocated so that generations alive at the same time have similar living standards in the light of these observations we discuss appropriate responses to a variety of economic shocks and we conclude with implications for policy in the aftermath of the recession the authors published by oxford university press
the banking legislation of the s took very little time to pass was unusually comprehensive and unusually responsive to public opinion ironically the primary motivations for the main bank regulatory reforms in the s regulation q the separation of investment banking from commercial banking and the creation of federal deposit insurance were to preserve and enhance two of the most disastrous policies that contributed to the severity and depth of the great depressionunit banking and the real bills doctrine other regulatory changes affecting the allocation of power between the federal reserve system fed and the treasury were intended to reduce the independence of the fed while giving the opposite impression banking reforms in the s had significant negative consequences for the future of us banking and took a long time to disappear the overarching lesson is that the aftermath of crises are moments of high risk in public policy the author published by oxford university press

this paper begins by arguing that the credit crunch does not require a fundamental reevaluation of monetary policy the crunch occurred because regulation was too lax and we need to develop new and more effective tools of regulatory control to focus on current account imbalances or mistakes in setting interest rates as a prime cause of the credit crunch is unconvincing and has the danger of diverting attention away from the need to increase financial regulation the current recession does require a reevaluation of the role fiscal policy can play when interest rates hit a zero bound an expansionary fiscal policy is required because monetary policymakers are reluctant to promise higher future inflation and the impact of quantitative easing is likely to be small although rising debt may place a limit on how much conventional fiscal policy can do not all expansionary fiscal measures require additional borrowing there are two important lessons for the future first although monetary policy should remain the primary tool to stabilize the business cycle the combination of fiscal implementation lags and uncertainty means that some precautionary fiscal action may be appropriate during the early phase of some economic downturns second to play this backstop stabilization role effectively a policy that results in the government debttogdp ratio declining albeit gradually and erratically in normal times seems appropriate the author published by oxford university press

this paper considers how environmental policies should respond to macroeconomic downturns it first explores the implications of the global economic downturn of for environmental policies focusing in particular on the example of action against climate change the arguments for and against activist fiscal policies in general are then reviewed and the case made that a demandinduced downturn provides a very good opportunity to undertake a necessary step change in the public spending component of environmental policies and to start working through a backlog of public investment to improve the environment fiscal policy should be used to improve the allocation of resources across time and space recent fiscal stimuli are considered in the light of this discussion it is also argued that there is little cause to delay the introduction of price signals to internalize environmental externalities but the levels at which such signals should be set requires careful analysis changes over the business cycle may be warranted depending on the nature of the environmental externality and the causes of the business cycle in question the authors published by oxford university press
in this paper we discuss the lessons learned from the us banking panics in the s for the response by the federal reserve to the crisis of we revisit the debate over illiquidity versus insolvency in the banking crises of the s and provide empirical evidence that the banking crises largely reflected illiquidity shocks in the recent crisis the fed under bernanke had well learned the lesson from the banking panics of the s of conducting expansionary monetary policy to meet demands for liquidity however unlike in the s the deeper problem of the recent crisis was not illiquidity but insolvency and especially the fear of insolvency of counterparties a number of virtually insolvent us banks deemed too big and too interconnected to fail were rescued by fiscal bailouts the authors published by oxford university press
the population in the developed world has experienced a significant increase in life expectancy over the last years simultaneously while the onset of comorbidities has been deferred to older age groups healthcare expenditure has grown dramatically primarily owing to the advancement of medical technology and the expansion of individual income levels along with population ageing in the wake of increased longevity however the contribution of population ageing to health expenditure growth is subject to some theoretical and empirical scrutiny this paper takes the question of ageing and health and health care to the data to evaluate the net impact of ageing we focus on two main questions namely the welfare valuation of longevity improvements for various oecd countries along with the red herring hypothesis which suggests that population ageing has a small and almost negligible impact on healthcare expenditure our estimates lead us to suggest an average gain in longevity of years since corresponding to about per cent of lifetime income of a yearold in furthermore we confirm a weak redherring claim that is that population ageing accounts for only a per cent annual growth rate of healthcare expenditure finally we find that the rise in longevity leads to a further demand for lifeprolonging medical care the authors published by oxford university press
the paper considers the case for an internationally coordinated further fiscal stimulus during the second half of although this makes some of the analysis periodspecific most of the issues and principles considered are timeless for a fiscal stimulus to be both effective there must be idle resources due to a failure of effective demand for it to be desirable there must be no alternative policy instruments including monetary policy for boosting demand there must be no complete financial crowding out and no complete direct crowding out through ricardian equivalencedebt neutrality through minsky equivalence or through a high degree of substitutability between private and public exhaustive expenditure in private preferences or production possibilities finally for international coordination to be desirable there must be crossborder externalities from national fiscal stimuli the paper considers each of these conditions in turn the author published by oxford university press
in this article we describe some important themes in energy and environmental policy there are two main reasons for our interest in these policies first such policies will likely be important in the coming decades as issues related to climate change and energy security come to the fore second there are important lessons to be learned from a careful review of the actual performance of energy and environmental policies we undertake a selective survey of the literature to highlight what is known about the efficiency of particular kinds of policies laws and regulations in these areas this paper makes three key contributions the first is to synthesize a large literature on energy and environmental policy in a way that can be easily digested by both nonexperts and experts the second contribution is to suggest that if history is a guide then we should not expect many interventions in these policy areas to come close to maximizing net economic benefits the third is to suggest what might be needed for the development of more efficient energy and environmental policies the authors published by oxford university press
this paper provides a survey of the great depression comprising both a narrative account and a detailed review of the empirical evidence focusing especially on the experience of the united states we examine the reasons for and flawed resolution of the american banking crisis as well as the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy we also consider the pivotal role of the gold standard in the international transmission of the slump and leaving gold as a route to recovery policy lessons for today from the great depression are discussed as are some implications for macroeconomics the authors published by oxford university press
in the face of rapid population ageing the longrun fall in effective retirement ages in most oecd countries needs to be reversed there are some positive signs that this is beginning to happen but early exit from the labour force ie well before official oldage pension ages still remains a very common phenomenon in oecd countries in this paper we first compare recent trends in the labour situation of older workers across oecd countries this is followed by a discussion of supplyside and demandside factors that have been driving these trends in particular new evidence is presented on incentives to retire that are embedded in pension systems we conclude that recent reforms in most countries in this area are working in the direction of encouraging later retirement although in a few countries there are still substantial incentives to stop working early we then examine to what extent there are barriers on the demand side which may also be discouraging work at an older age such as age discrimination seniority rules in wage setting low training participation and employment protection rules we conclude that countries have also begun to tackle these barriers as well nevertheless while considerable pension reform has undoubtedly strengthened incentives to continue working at an older age further action is still required on the demand side to ensure that those older workers who wish to work longer can do so the authors published by oxford university press
climate change has been described as one of the biggest market failures less attention has been paid to the government failures associated with interventions and the implications for the design of climate change policy this paper sets out the main types of government failure and shows how the processes of rentseeking and capture help to explain both why the choice of targets and instruments has been so inefficient and also why the resulting costs of carbon mitigation are likely to be considerably higher than the estimates provided by the stern review and other recent studies two examples are given emissions trading and renewables policy a number of generic conclusions are drawn about how taking account of government failures can help to improve policy design and limit the impact of the climate change pork barrel which existing policies have created the author published by oxford university press
in this paper i survey and reinterpret the extensive literature on europes great depression i argue that europe could not exploit its vast economic potential after because the war had not yet come to an endindeed it did not end before both domestic and international institutions suffered from a lack of reciprocal trust and commitment which can be clearly illustrated in the realm of monetary policy but affected many other areas of policymaking such as energy or migration policies these institutions in turn affected expectations and thereby the extent to which for example expansionary policies could be effective the author published by oxford university press
current economic turbulence has revived interest in interwar macroeconomic instability and policy this paper provides a guide to the current state of knowledge on british macroeconomic policy between and the eve of the second world war for todays economists and policymakers mindful that some will seek lessons from this earlier age it makes clear the very particular economic and policy context of the time including the marked difference between british and american economic performance and policies and the challenge posed by the massive rise in debt brought about by the first world war knowledge transfer is possible here for policy learning but what transpires is that lessons are typically stronger as negatives than as positives namely what should not be done in general as against what might be done this largely situation specific the focus is the role and effectiveness of the monetary and fiscal policies pursued together with an assessment of the principal policy not adopted namely the keynesian solution of significant loanfinanced public works to remedy mass unemployment the analysis is comparative with respect to us macroeconomic economic performance and policy it explores the different macroeconomic shocks of the contraction phase the term great depression is not really appropriate to the british experience in the two countries comparative policy regimes and then in turn analyses the policy mix and policy effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy including for britain the counterfactual keynesian solution a businesscycle periodization is adopted with the key role for the abandonment of the gold standard in terms of regaining freedom of choice in macroeconomic policy itself experiencing significant developments after the traditional role of the cheapmoneyinduced housing boom in britains post economic recovery is reaffirmed the impact of the fiscal policies actually pursued are then discussed as are assessments of the likely effectiveness of the keynesian solution had the liberal partys we can conquer unemployment spending package been implemented the author published by oxford university press
environmental policy is made in a context of both market failure and government failure on the one hand leaving environmental protection to the free market relying on notions of corporate social responsibility and altruistic consumer and shareholder preferences will not deliver optimal results on the other hand nationalizing the delivery of environmental protection is likely to fail because nation states rarely have the depth and quality of information required to instruct all the relevant agents to make appropriate decisions thus as for many areas of policy appropriate models of environmental intervention will lie between these two extremes while it is impossible to specify general rules concerning the precise form of intervention in part because the type of intervention depends upon value judgements this paper sets out some of the considerations that are particular to environmental policy and explores several principles for policy design including information coordination and principalagent problems with a particular focus on the international context the author published by oxford university press
the worlds leading economies both developed and developing are engaged in an everchanging economic symbiosis that is governed in large part by demographics and technological change but also by pension healthcare and other fiscal policies this interconnected economic evolutionwhat economists call general equilibrium growthholds important implications for inequality across and within generations this paper presents such a general equilibrium model it features six goods five regions three skill groups and overlapping generations each making lifecycle consumption and laboursupply decisions the model pays special attention to the evolution of the chinese and indian economies thanks to their rapid technological advance and vast populations these nations will play an ever more dominant role in determining the worlds supplies of capital and labour particularly unskilled labour the good news for the developed world is that china and india will supply it with major amounts of capital over time thanks to their high saving rates the bad news is that these economies are also likely to bring much more unskilled relative to skilled labour into the market which will over time dramatically reduce the relative wages of unskilled workers in the us europe and japan this relative increase in the world supply of unskilled workers reflects in large part the simple fact that china and india are gradually bringing each of their skill groups up to western standards but have relatively more unskilled labour in their work forces the authors published by oxford university press
over the next four decades increasing oldage dependency ratios will exert an enormous upward pressure on welfare spending in most developed countries as this is mainly due to existing unfunded public pension schemes many countries have embarked on farreaching reforms in this area strengthening actuarial fairness modifying indexation rules adding elements of prefunding and last but not least attempting to extend the period of economic activity efforts to contain costs may also be relevant with regard to public expenditure on health and longterm care but thus far no country has started to really deal with these issues still some countries have made substantial progress in securing the longterm sustainability of their welfare systems what remains to be considered is reconstructing the system of intergenerational transactions as a potential way of removing disincentives to raise children and invest in their human capital in the long run the authors published by oxford university press
this paper takes a close look at the keynesian theory underlying the policy of fiscal stimulus being undertaken or considered in many countries led by the united states a central question is whether a debtfinanced fiscal stimulus now must adversely affect future taxpayers owing to the debt burden being created there are many interesting issues considered for example the role of automatic stabilizers and the basis for keyness paradox of thrift the model used is for a single country with a floating exchange rate it is assumed that for various reasons monetary policy cannot eliminate high unemployment and a resultant output gap in fact there is a market failure which government action needs to compensate for at least temporarily the author published by oxford university press
the recent global economic crisis originated in the midst of a commodity price boom that had triggered sharp increases in inflation in many world countries the crisis also came in the context of a rally in asset prices and large domestic imbalances in the united states this paper uses a small openeconomy dynamic stochastic general equilibrum dsge model to design the correct monetary policy response to a protracted supply shock and examines how that response would change when many become credit constrainedlike in a credit crunchand when spending of those who can still borrow becomes very sensitive to the interest rates because of overleveraging using a version of the model with kalman learning the paper also evaluates the implications of a loss of target credibility showing how rules must be adjusted when the authorities commitment to the inflation target has been eroded the appropriate response to future evolutions of the price of oil including to large downward corrections from the current level is also evaluated the authors published by oxford university press
the recent financial crisis and subsequent deterioration in macroeconomic outcomes have raised question marks over the framework for monetary policy in the united kingdom this paper examines the performance of the uks monetary policy framework in the light of these questions far from concluding that inflation targeting needs to be replaced we argue in the paper that the regime has provided a clear policy compass that facilitated strong and decisive monetary policy decisions during the financial crisis we argue that it should remain the mainstay of the uk macroeconomic policy framework even so lessons need to be learnt to prevent financial market excesses from destabilizing the economy in future the single most important being the need to expand the range of instruments available to policymakers the authors published by oxford university press
we focus on two international aspects of the great depressionfinancial crises and international tradeand try to discern lessons for the current economic crisis both downturns featured global banking crises which were generated by boomslump macroeconomic cycles during both crises world trade collapsed faster than world incomes and the trade decline was highly synchronized across countries during the depression income losses and rises in trade barriers explain trades collapse owing to vertical specialization and more intense trade in durables todays trade collapse is due to uncertainty and small shocks to trade costs hitting international supply chains so far the global economy has avoided the global trade wars and banking collapses of the depression perhaps owing to improved policy even so the global economy remains susceptible to large shocks owing to financial innovation and technological change as recent events illustrate the authors published by oxford university press

the new deal produced a fundamental change in the structure of american government the national government came to play a much larger role in the financing of social welfare programmes while administration of the programmes was largely located at the states both the purely national and the shared federal parts of the welfare system were characterized by impersonal rules the political economy of how the rules came about and how the new deal experience may have contributed to americans changing their views on the danger of dealing with the national government is the primary focus the paper closes with speculations about the possible effect of changing views on american participation in the second world war after the author published by oxford university press
we describe in this essay why the gold standard and the euro are extreme forms of fixed exchange rates and how these policies had their most potent effects in the worst peaceful economic periods in modern times while we are lucky to have avoided another catastrophe like the great depression in mainly by virtue of policymakers aggressive use of monetary and fiscal stimuli the world economy is still experiencing many difficulties as in the great depression this second round of problems stems from the prevalence of fixed exchange rates fixed exchange rates facilitate business and communication in good times but intensify problems when times are bad the authors published by oxford university press
insurance for longterm care ltc has developed only moderately compared to other areas of welfare which has been explained variously as the result of market failures public misconceptions of the risk of ltc needs and intergenerational contracts this paper offers a cultural explanation for the limited ltc insurance development in europe it argues that family ties by enhancing informal caregiving duties inhibit individuals expected public and private insurance coverage the empirical analysis of the paper exploits crosscountry and subgroup variability of a representative database of european union member states containing records on ltc coverage and family structure drawing upon two measures of familistic culture or family ties we find a negative association between family ties and expected coverage of ltc for different subsamples these results are robust to a set of checks for different definitions of family ties and controls and for a subsample of first and secondgeneration migrants policy implications suggest that widespread expansion of ltc coverage might need to accommodate existing familistic cultural norms to avoid insurance crowding out the author published by oxford university press
influenced by the success of emission trading in the us for sulphur dioxide so some economists have argued for an upstream economywide capandtrade scheme as the primary tool for achieving the required reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions this paper addresses that argument and concludes that capandtrade will need to be accompanied by complementary regulatory measures while it is a necessary component in a climate mitigation programme it is unlikely to be sufficient by itself to accomplish the desired emission reductions the paper reviews the evidence on how so emissions were reduced and the extent to which actual emission trading was responsible for the reduction as opposed to other innovations it also identifies differences between the past regulation of so and other air pollutants and the challenges presented by the regulation of ghg emissions what actually happened in the us with so emission trading deviated in several significant respects from what would be predicted based on the conventional theoretical analysis while there was a dramatic reduction in so emissions it occurred because of several factors some of which are unlikely to apply for ghg emissions and others of which argue for an activist regulatory policy by the government as a complement to the functioning of an emissions market for ghgs the author published by oxford university press

there is an increasing demand for putting a shadow price on the environment to guide public policy and incentivize private behaviour in practice setting that price can be extremely difficult as uncertainties abound there is often uncertainty not just about individual parameters but about the structure of the problem and how to model it a further complication is the secondbest nature of real environmental policymaking in this paper we propose some practical steps for setting prices in the face of these difficulties drawing on the example of climate change we consider how to determine the overall target for environmental protection how to set shadow prices to deliver that target and how we can learn from the performance of policies to revise targets and prices perhaps most significantly we suggest that estimates of the marginal cost of environmental protection rather than the marginal benefit will often provide the more consistent and robust prices for achieving targets the authors published by oxford university press
we assess fiscal policy from the perspective of fairness between generations and the relationship between this and national saving in the context where the united kingdom is one of the lowest saving of all the oecd economies crosssection and pooled data suggest that governments are in a position to influence national saving and we set out a simple overlapping generation model to show the effects of national debt of payasyoubenefit systems and of legacies and movements to land prices as means of effecting transfers between generations having shown that governments can influence the distribution of resources between generations we then discuss three notions of fairness between generations i that each cohort should pay its own way ii that a social planner should reallocate resources between generations to achieve an intertemporal optimum and iii that resources should be reallocated so that generations alive at the same time have similar living standards in the light of these observations we discuss appropriate responses to a variety of economic shocks and we conclude with implications for policy in the aftermath of the recession the authors published by oxford university press
the banking legislation of the s took very little time to pass was unusually comprehensive and unusually responsive to public opinion ironically the primary motivations for the main bank regulatory reforms in the s regulation q the separation of investment banking from commercial banking and the creation of federal deposit insurance were to preserve and enhance two of the most disastrous policies that contributed to the severity and depth of the great depressionunit banking and the real bills doctrine other regulatory changes affecting the allocation of power between the federal reserve system fed and the treasury were intended to reduce the independence of the fed while giving the opposite impression banking reforms in the s had significant negative consequences for the future of us banking and took a long time to disappear the overarching lesson is that the aftermath of crises are moments of high risk in public policy the author published by oxford university press

efficiency improvements in energy use are nowadays one of the main concerns of policy makers and plans of action have been designed to achieve targets such as those of the kyoto protocol the measure of their success will depend on the degree that these plans spread through the system in this light the interindustry linkages turn out to be quite significant for the effectiveness of policies we propose in this paper an adaptation of the hypothetical extraction method to measure the role of energy and nonenergy efficiency gains in an interconnected multisectorial economy while relating the results to the rebound effects literature elsevier bv

the correct identification of the time series path of nonrenewable energy resources has far reaching consequences for economists and policymakers alike this study builds on the existing literature by employing a data series that includes a sample period of institutional change and recently developed unit root testing procedures besides crude oil natural gas and coal prices are also examined aiming to further the knowledge of nonrenewable energy resource time paths in order to inform future research and update the conclusions of past studies the unit root tests allow for structural breaks and are based on the procedures developed by zivot and andrews lumsdaine and papell and lee and strazicich finally we investigate whether the trend changes signs in the regimes which are bounded by the structural breaks and quantify the prevalence of the trends over the sample period considered the results show that the trend is not well represented by a single positive or negative trend the variability of the trend suggests that forecasting energy prices should not typically occur about a single trend elsevier bv
this study empirically establishes the direction of causality between electricity consumption and economic growth in burkina faso for the period the bounds test yields evidence of cointegration between electricity consumption gdp and capital formation when electricity consumption and gdp are used as dependent variable causality results indicate that there is no significant causal relationship between electricity consumption and investment estimates however detect in the longrun a bidirectional causal relationship between electricity use and real gdp there is also evidence of a positive feedback causal relationship between gdp and capital formation burkina faso is therefore an energy dependent country it is also a country in which electricity consumption is growing with the level of income all of this shows that electricity is a significant factor in socioeconomic development in burkina faso as such energy policy must be implemented to ensure that electricity generates fewer potential negative impacts elsevier bv

concerns about co emissions create incentives for the development and deployment of energy technologies that do not use fossil fuels indeed such technologies would provide tangible benefits in terms of avoided fossilfuel costs which are likely to increase as restrictions on co emissions are imposed however a number of challenges need to be overcome prior to market deployment and the commercialisation of alternative energy technologies may require a staged approach given price and technical risk we analyse how a firm may proceed with staged commercialisation and deployment of competing alternative energy technologies an unconventional new alternative technology is one possibility where one could undertake costreducing production enhancement measures as an intermediate step prior to deployment by contrast the firm could choose to deploy a smallerscale existing renewable energy technology and using the real options framework we compare the two projects to provide managerial implications on how one might proceed elsevier bv

a proper modeling of the longrun behavior of energy and oil intensities is crucial in many respects this paper aims at checking whether this longrun behavior should be modelled as a deterministic or a stochastic trend or both we first apply a test for a deterministic trend robust to uncertainty about the stochastic trend our results indicate that for the period energy intensities of only oecd countries out of include a negative deterministic trend include a positive one and seem to be better modelled by a stochastic trend only when considering a sample of nonoecd countries on the period we show that only exhibit a deterministic trend negative for countries and positive for countries a similar analysis for oil intensity leads to reject the hypothesis of an insignificant deterministic trend for oecd countries out of for the period and nonoecd countries out of for the period in the next step we apply standard unit root tests and find that the unit root hypothesis is not very often rejected we conclude that a main feature of energy intensities is the presence of a stochastic trend elsevier bv
this study presents a policy benefit evaluation model that integrates cost efficiency curve information on renewable power generation technologies into real options analysis roa methods the proposed model evaluates quantitatively the policy value provided by developing renewable energy re in the face of uncertain fossil fuel prices and re policyrelated factors the economic intuition underlying the policymaking process is elucidated while empirical analysis illustrates the option value embedded in the current development policy in taiwan for wind power in addition to revealing the benefits that re development provides when considering real options analytical results indicate that roa is a highly effective means of quantifying how policy planning uncertainty including managerial flexibility influences re development in addition to assessing the policy value of current re development policy this study also compares policy values in terms of internalized external costs and varying feedin tariff fit simulation results demonstrate that the re development policy with internalized co emission costs is appropriate policy planning from sustainability point of view furthermore relationship between varying fit and policy values can be shown quantitatively and appropriate fit level could be determined accordingly elsevier bv

in the late s several proposals for a structural reform that would bring competition and market prices to the russian gas industry were intensely debated splitting up russian gas monopolist gazprom into several producing companies was a considered option in this paper i examine theoretically and numerically how a splitup of gazprom would affect russian national welfare results show that under the current gas market structures in europe and russia the splitup of gazproms monopoly might not be beneficial for russia however analysis in the paper indicates that the market shares that gazprom has in both russian domestic and european gas markets are important in determining whether gazproms dominance is supported under the national welfare criteria when gazprom has small market share in europe and large market share in russia a breakup of gazprom might plausibly result in increase of russian national welfare elsevier bv
this paper is the first attempt to investigate i is the crude oil wti price significantly related to the regional ethylene prices in the naphtha intensive ethylene markets of the far east north west europe and the mediterranean ii what drives the regional ethylene prices the paper is motivated by the recent and growing debate on the leadlag relationship between crude oil and ethylene prices our findings based on the longrun structural modelling approach of pesaran and shin and subject to the limitations of the study tend to suggest i crude oil wti price is cointegrated with the regional ethylene prices ii our withinsample errorcorrection model results tend to indicate that although the ethylene prices in north west europe and the mediterranean were weakly endogenous the far east ethylene price was weakly exogenous both in the short and long term these results are consistent during most of the period under review with the surge in demand for ethylene throughout the far east particularly in china and south korea however during the postsample forecast period as evidenced in our variance decompositions analysis the emergence of wti as a leading player as well is consistent with the recent surge in wti price fuelled mainly among others by the strong hedging activities in the wti futuresoptions and refining tightness reflecting the growing importance of input cost in determining the dynamic interactions of input and product prices elsevier bv
empirical evidence from the new york iso shows that the clearing prices for pointtopoint congestion revenue rights also known as financial transmission rights ftrs resulting from centralized auctions conducted by independent system operators differ significantly and systematically from the realized congestion revenues that determine the accrued payoffs of these rights the question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structurewe show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the clearing prices for the ftrs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right ftr auction in particular we prove that quantity limits on the ftr bids may cause the auction clearing prices to differ from the bid prices this phenomenon which is inherent in the theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to clear the auction is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems we conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the ftrs secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence elsevier bv

there is a large collection of literature on energy price forecasting but most studies typically use monthly average or closetoclose daily price data in practice the daily price range constructed from the daily high and low also contains useful information on price volatility and is used frequently in technical analysis the interaction between the daily high and low and the associated daily range has been examined in several recent studies on stock price and exchange rate forecasts the present paper adopts a similar approach to analyze the behaviour of the west texas intermediate wti crude oil price over a tenyear period we find that daily highs and lows of the wti oil price are cointegrated with the error correction term being closely approximated by the daily price range two forecasting models one based on a vector error correction mechanism and the other based on a transfer function framework with the range taken as a driver variable are presented for forecasting the daily highs and lows the results show that both of these models offer significant advantages over the nave random walk and univariate arima models in terms of outofsample forecast accuracy a trading strategy that makes use of the daily high and low forecasts is further developed it is found that this strategy generally yields very reasonable trading returns over an evaluation period of about two years elsevier bv
using a neoclassical aggregate production model where capital labour technology and energy are treated as separate inputs this paper tests for the existence and direction of causality between output growth and electrical energy use in barbados analysed as a whole and in sectors respectively results indicate the presence of a longrun relationship between growth and electricity consumption specifically we find that the nonresidential sector is a key driver of growth in addition the evidence reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between electrical energy consumption and real gdp in the long run but only a unidirectional causal relationship from energy to output in the short run forecasts indicate increasing consumption of electrical energy particularly by the residential sector we suggest that plans by the government to liberalise the sector should encourage efficiency and innovation in production and distribution which should result in lower prices as independent suppliers compete to maintain their market shares changes in the regulatory environment will also be necessary if such plans materialise policymakers will need to pay greater attention to the expected increase in the rate of consumption by the residential sector as this will help to reduce the imports of oil and depletion of scarce foreign exchange resources by a sector that does not spur economic growth an increase in energy capacity should be encouraged as contingency planning in the event of a technical or political disruption to fuel imports will be critical notwithstanding the drive to use more renewable sources of energy elsevier bv

in great britain several policy measures have been implemented in order to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the domestic sector this could for example be achieved by improving space heating efficiency and thus decreasing heating expenditure however in order to efficiently design and implement such policy measures a better understanding of the determinants affecting heating expenditure is needed in this paper we examine the following determinants socioeconomic factors building characteristics heating technologies and weather conditions in contrast to most other studies we use panel data to investigate household demand for heating in great britain our data sample is the result of an annual set of interviews with more than households starting in and ending in the sample represents a total of observations over the fifteenyear period our aim is to derive price and income elasticities both for britain as a whole and for different types of household our results suggest that differences exist between owneroccupied and renter households these households react differently to changes in income and prices our results also imply that a number of socioeconomic criteria have a significant influence on heating expenditure independently of the fuel used for heating understanding the impacts of different factors on heating expenditure and impact differences between types of household is helpful in designing targetoriented policy measures elsevier bv
empirical research on market inefficiencies focuses on the detection of autocorrelations in price time series in the case of crude oil markets statistical support is claimed for weak efficiency over a wide range of timescales however the results are still controversial since theoretical arguments point to deviations from efficiency as prices tend to revert towards an equilibrium path this paper studies the efficiency of crude oil markets by using lagged detrended fluctuation analysis dfa to detect delay effects in price autocorrelations quantified in terms of a multiscaling hurst exponent ie autocorrelations are dependent of the time scale results based on spot price data for the period indicate important deviations from efficiency associated to lagged autocorrelations so imposing the random walk for crude oil prices has pronounced costs for forecasting evidences in favor of price reversion to a continuously evolving mean underscores the importance of adequately incorporating delay effects and multiscaling behavior in the modeling of crude oil price dynamics elsevier bv

a regime dependent var model is suggested that allows long memory fractional integration in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration the model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods for a system of bilateral prices noncongestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart hence the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under noncongestion and a bivariate price process under congestion at the same time it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegratedanalysis of nord pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under noncongestion the prices are not in general fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state hence in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism finally the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models elsevier bv

regardless of the apparent need for product eliminations many managers hesitate to act as they fear deleterious effects on customer satisfaction and loyalty other managers do carry out product eliminations but often fail to consider the consequences for customers and business relationships given the relevance and problems of product eliminations research on this topic in general and on the consequences for customers and business relationships in particular is surprisingly scarce therefore this empirical study explores how and to what extent the elimination of a product negatively affects customers and business relationships results indicate that eliminating a product may result in severe economic and psychological costs to customers thereby seriously decreasing customer satisfaction and loyalty this paper also shows that these costs are not exogenous in nature instead depending on the characteristics of the eliminated product these costs are found to be more or less strongly driven by a companys behavior when implementing the elimination at the customer interface academy of marketing science

using representative samples of u s and japanese retail service firms this study explores whether one particular type of organizational culture is the best with respect to business outcomes performance and customer satisfaction or whether the optimum culture depends on the national context in which the firm is embedded the findings suggest that there is a significant interaction effect of organizational culture with national culture on outcomes specifically the relationships between the importance placed on the cultural values of stability people orientation and detail orientation and outcomes are significantly greater for japanese than for u s service retailers on the other hand the relationships between the values of aggressiveness innovation and outcome orientation and outcomes are greater for u s retailers further the findings show that firms whose cultures match those of their home countries exhibit lower levels of outcomes when they operate in other countries with different cultural values implications are given for how service retailers might be designed and managed for purposes of improving business outcomes academy of marketing science
the research examines the moderating effect of environmental unpredictability on the relationships of two supply chain information technologies it on operational and financial performance the results show that the greater the environmental unpredictability the weaker the effect of bb ecommerce that integrates the firm with supply chain members on operational and financial performance in contrast the greater the environmental unpredictability the stronger the effect of supply chain analytic it that fosters operational and strategic decisionmaking on operational and financial performance academy of marketing science
this research examines whether suppliers capabilities impact oem customers dependence on the supplier and thereby generate customer loyalty using a sample of purchasing managers focusing on a single key component supplier we examine three supplier capabilities two dependence dimensions and three aspects of customer loyalty core offering capability increases the customer firms benefitbased dependence operations capability has a more comprehensive effect enhancing both benefitbased and costbased dependence benefitbased dependence leads to relational loyalty and through its effect on relational loyalty to insensitivity to competitive offerings and future purchase expansion costbased dependence motivates insensitivity to competitive offerings but does not affect relational loyalty or purchase expansion the suppliers communication capability is associated with relational loyalty but this effect does not flow through the customer firms dependence the divergent pattern of antecedents and effects of benefitbased dependence and costbased dependence may explain the inconsistent and insignificant research findings in previous research on dependence our results suggest that adopting a bidimensional model of dependence more fully captures the theoretical domain of dependence thereby permitting researchers to better examine its role in supply chain channel and marketing relationships academy of marketing science
it has been years since the publication of a comprehensive review of the full spectrum of salesperformance drivers this study takes stock of the contemporary field and synthesizes empirical evidence from the period the authors revise the classification scheme for sales performance determinants devised by walker et al and estimate both the predictive validity of its subcategories and the impact of a range of moderators on determinantsales performance relationships based on multivariate causal model analysis the results make two major observations five subcategories demonstrate significant relationships with sales performance sellingrelated knowledge degree of adaptiveness role ambiguity cognitive aptitude and work engagement these subcategories are moderated by measurement method research context and salestype variables the authors identify managerial implications of the results and offer suggestions for further research including the conjecture that as the world is moving toward a knowledgeintensive economy salespeople could be functioning as knowledgebrokers the results seem to back this supposition and indicate how it might inspire future research in the field of personal selling the authors
the constructs of perceived control and convenience have been identified in previous qualitative studies of selfservice technology sst use as important factors yet empirically their effects are relatively unknown based on the theory of planned behavior this study explores how control and convenience perceptions influence customers utilitarian speed of transaction and hedonic exploration motivations for using an sst in addition we explore how trust in a service provider influences customers future sst intentions two studies were undertaken to assess both users and nonusers evaluations of an sst the results revealed that perceived control and convenience do impact the intentions of customers to use an sst in the future however their impact was mediated through the constructs of speed of transaction exploration and trust increased control and convenience perceptions influenced exploration trust and speed evaluations which in turn were associated with stronger perceived value higher sst satisfaction judgments and increased sst usage intentions managerial implications stemming from the empirical findings are discussed along with directions for future research academy of marketing science
the authors fill a gap in the salesperson performance literature by exploring the process that salespeople follow in coordinating the activities of ad hoc team members during highopportunity customer engagements in the business market in a twophase study the authors conduct depth interviews with salespeople and survey sales managers from a fortune company to identify the processes involved in the coordination of expertise in phase i analysis of qualitative data reveals that higherperforming salespeople are more likely to consider relational as well as technical skills when matching team members to customer requirements attract their preferred experts to the team including a member to perform the project manager role and define the appropriate time in the sales cycle to initiate contact with the customer and deploy the team to the customer organization adopting a social network perspective in phase ii the reputation of a salespersons internal working relationships and to a lesser extent the diversity and strength of their relationship ties are central in explaining effective coordination of expertise in turn coordination of expertise is linked to salesperson performance academy of marketing science
the concreteness principle and the prominence hypothesis are used as a theoretical basis for hypothesizing the effects of two important information display factors attribute concreteness and attribute prominence on consumer selective information processing the results of two studies indicate that attribute concreteness together with attribute correlation leads to the selective processing of attributes while attribute prominence and attribute correlation results in the selective processing of alternatives moreover selective processing mediates the impact of these display factors on choice while reducing the amount of information search further the amount of information search and experienced cognitive effort mediate the effects of selective processing on consumer affect during the search process the research is important from a theoretical standpoint because it fills an important knowledge gap in the literature on how information environment influences affect selective processing and choice it is important from a marketing strategy perspective because it examines how a merchant can influence consumer choice by merely changing the manner in which attribute information is displayed or alternatives are initially organized ie presorted academy of marketing science
to develop appropriate theories of business relationship management we need to understand what types of relations exist and the differing types of problems they pose for the firms involved we report the results of research to develop an empirically based taxonomy of buyerseller business relations from data that include both buyer and seller firm perspectives cluster analysis is used to identify five types of relations based on measures of relationship atmosphere that share similarities and some important differences with previous typologies a comparison of typologies shows that some obscure and confound relationship types by forcing them into predefined groups that the same type of relationship atmosphere is compatible with more than one pattern of behavior and that the estimated correlations among relationship variables are sensitive to the mix of relations included in the sample future research that can build on this work the challenges that this kind of research presents and the methodologies to help address them are then discussed academy of marketing science
technology has the ability to heavily influence marketing and supply chain theory and practice this research incorporates a twostudy approach to examine the impact of collaborative supply chain technologies on retailer logistics service and financial performance and ultimately on the overall performance of the partnership in this study we discover dynamic interactions between collaborative technology categories relationship quality resource complementarity and performance the results support the importance of collaborative technologies the role of different degrees of partnering and the need for a better understanding of firm and partner performance ultimately this study creates a foundation for future research across the domains of marketing and supply chain management incorporating the resource based view of technology and servicedominant logic academy of marketing science
previous research in the product failure literature shows that such failures have important implications for evaluations of the target product and even for evaluations of closely related products the current studies identify distrust as an additional byproduct of negative expectancy disconfirmation and show that such perceptions are capable of producing even broader carryover effectspertaining to unrelated productscompanies the effects of distrust are identified through tests of mediation and moderation and are shown to be distinct from other processes known to relate to product failure the results also show an asymmetry in the effects of positive and negative disconfirmation consistent with the predicted negativity bias in judgments of generalized trust versus generalized distrust finally generalized distrust continued to exert a negative influence despite the opportunity to directly examine the second product and these effects were actually augmented to some extent the results have implications for the expectancy disconfirmation and product failure literatures as well as the defensive bias model of distrust academy of marketing science
salesperson learning has the potential to contribute to the competitive advantage of the firm by increasing its capacity for organizational learning the relationship between employee and organizational learning is often takenforgranted yet the relationship between the two is complicated the transfer of individual learning to the organizational level can not always be assumed the authors examine this relationship focusing on the facilitating role of organizational climate for learning and information dissemination efficiency in translating salesperson learning to organizational learning the model tested using a sample of respondents from retail stores in a national chain is partly supported individual learning was found to be postitively associated with organizational learning and organizational climate for learning had a positive moderating effect on this relationship the hypothesized moderating effect of information dissemination efficiency was insignificant implications for theory and management are discussed academy of marketing science
trading partners continue to make significant investments in information technology it infrastructure to facilitate the flow of market information across supply chains yet the underlying mechanisms linking it implementation to firm performance have not been clearly specified drawing on the resourceadvantage theory of competition we develop and test a model that proposes marketoriented it competence as a mediator of the effects of a firms it infrastructure on market information flow which in turn yields comparative advantages in supply chain relationships marketoriented it competence is conceptualized as a firms ability to deploy an it infrastructure in support of the organizationwide collection dissemination and use of market information to respond to market needs we test the effects of marketoriented it competence using data collected from managers in the logistics services industry findings show that marketoriented it competence is a critical link between it infrastructure and comparative advantage in supply chain relationships academy of marketing science
while wall street closely watches financial analysts earnings forecasts main street often scrutinizes product quality relative to competition do firms with superior product competitiveness enjoy greater likelihood of beating analyst earnings target and if so is there contingency in this impact we show that positive changes in product competitiveness contribute to the firms likelihood of beating analyst earnings target while negative changes in product competitiveness account for missed earnings target in addition this impact of product competitiveness on the likelihood of beating analyst earnings target is more positive in the situations of high firm future growth opportunity and low financial environment uncertainty these findings innovatively use analyst forecast metrics to reinforce the relationship between product quality competitive advantage and financial performanceour study also cultivates a contingency theory of the marketingfinance interface and allows marketing and finance executives to find common ground in strategic discourse overall this research offers brand new financial analystsbased implications of product competitiveness academy of marketing science
this article addresses a growing dilemma surrounding the strategic value of perceived brand foreignness pbf among consumers in emerging economies building on recent research evidence from the brand origin literature we introduce the concept of confidence in brand origin identification cbo and theorize its moderating impact on the value of pbf in explaining and predicting brand evaluation using a multilevel modeling technique this study provides evidence showing that cbo moderates the effect of pbf on consumer evaluations of brand value moreover the moderating influence of cbo is found to be more profound for local than for foreign brands managerial implications for building both global and local brands in emerging markets are discussed academy of marketing science
relationship maintenance customer retention and exclusivity and development increased service usage and crossbuying are top priorities in customer relationship management this paper examines how service companies can effectively influence customer patronage behaviors by leveraging overall customer satisfaction trust and relationship commitment using a longitudinal design over a twoyear period we merge survey metrics with actual patronage behaviors taken from a banks database we show that relationship commitment just enhances retention and exclusivity while trust directly influences service usage and crossbuying as a consequence trust appears to be highly critical for service relationship development and company profits furthermore trust and relationship commitment mediate the entire impact of satisfaction which appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition for relationship maintenance and development satisfaction and more generally service evaluations must be efficiently converted into trust and relationship commitment before providing business results finally we establish the temporal antecedence and the predictive power of trust and relationship commitment relationship commitment in year t predicts the number of service providers in year t exclusivity vs polygamy while trust in year t predicts the number of bank products crossbuying as well as the service usage level in year t we then discuss managerial implications for customer relationship maintenance and development academy of marketing science
drawing from transaction cost economics tce the knowledgebased view kbv and real options theory rot we propose that the general alliance experience of alliance partner firms moderates the impact of market uncertainty and alliancespecific uncertainty on the benefits and costs of the two marketing alliance governance modes ie nonequity alliances and joint ventures based on our systematic study of marketing alliances occurring in industries across countries between and we find general alliance experience significantly moderates firms marketing alliance governance mode choices our framework reconciles some contradictory empirical results in the interfirm relationship governance structure literature by emphasizing the moderating role of partner firms general alliance experience specifically when alliances can be characterized has having a large cultural distance between the partners or having a market with a broad geographic scope it seems that tce predictions regarding the marketing alliance governance mode choice hold for inexperienced firms while kbv and rot predictions hold for experienced firms in addition by incorporating key aspects of all three theories our proposed framework has the potential to provide deeper insights into the role of alliance experience and uncertainty in firms marketing alliance governance mode choices academy of marketing science
despite placing items in virtual shopping carts online shoppers frequently abandon them an issue that perplexes online retailers and has yet to be explained by scholars here we identify key drivers to online cart abandonment and suggest cognitive and behavioral reasons for this nonbuyer behavior we show that the factors influencing consumer online search consideration and evaluation play a larger role in cart abandonment than factors at the purchase decision stage in particular many customers use online carts for entertainment or as a shopping research and organizational tool which may induce them to buy at a later session or via another channel our framework extends theories of online buyer and nonbuyer behavior while revealing new inhibitors to buying in the internet era the findings offer scholars a broad explanation of consumer motivations for cart abandonment for retailers the authors provide suggestions to improve purch conversion rates and multichannel management academy of marketing science
this paper examines the relationship between extension difficulty defined as the perceived difficulty of manufacturing the extension product and attitudes toward brand extensions although extant literature has hitherto modeled this relationship as a simple monotonic relationship a study by bottomley and holden journal of marketing research has questioned its empirical generalizability we suggest that the relationship between extension difficulty and extension attitudes may be far more complex than a simple linear relationship based on theoretical evidence drawn from the concept of evaluation difficulty we suggest that the relationship between extension difficulty and extension attitudes is best modeled as a curvilinear inverted ushaped relationship further we explore the specific role of perceived transferability as a moderator of this curvilinear relationship empirical tests conducted using two studies provide support for both the theoretical mechanism and the proposed hypotheses entry into easy or extremely difficult extension categories carries its own penalties while entry into moderately difficult categories appears to garner high consumer attitudes for brand extensions academy of marketing science
strategy identifies two primary sets of processes through which the firm creates value for its customers by moving goods and information through marketing channels demandfocused and supplyfocused processes historically firms have invested resources to develop a core differential advantage in one or other of these areasbut rarely in bothoften resulting in mismatches between demand what customers want and supply what is available in the marketplace this paper suggests that successfully managing the supply chain to create customer value requires extensive integration between demandfocused processes and supplyfocused processes that is based on a foundation of value creation through intraorganizational knowledge management integrating demand and supply processes helps firms prioritize and ensure fulfillment based upon the shared generation dissemination interpretation and application of realtime customer demand as well as ongoing supply capacity constraints we draw upon literature in marketing logistics supply chain management and strategy to introduce a conceptual framework of demand and supply integration dsi we also offer insights for managerial practice and an agenda for future research in the relatively underresearched but strategically important area of demand and supply integration academy of marketing science
this paper proposes a domain statement for strategic marketing as a field of study and delineates certain issues fundamental to the field it also proposes a definition for marketing strategy the focal organizational strategy construct of the field and enumerates a number of foundational premises of marketing strategy the domain of strategic marketing is viewed as encompassing the study of organizational interorganizational and environmental phenomena concerned with the behavior of organizations in the marketplace in their interactions with consumers customers competitors and other external constituencies in the context of creation communication and delivery of products that offer value to customers in exchanges with organizations and the general management responsibilities associated with the boundary spanning role of the marketing function in organizations at the broadest level marketing strategy can be defined as an organizations integrated pattern of decisions that specify its crucial choices concerning products markets marketing activities and marketing resources in the creation communication andor delivery of products that offer value to customers in exchanges with the organization and thereby enables the organization to achieve specific objectives chief among the issues that are fundamental to strategic marketing as a field of study are the questions of how the marketing strategy of a business is influenced by demand side factors and supply side factors academy of marketing science
crosscultural studies using hofstedes national scores to operationalize his five cultural factors at an individual level suffer from ecological fallacy and those using selfreport scales treat cultural factors as unidimensional constructs and provide little or no evidence of the construct validity and measurement equivalence of these scales this paper reconceptualizes hofstedes five cultural factors as ten personal cultural orientations and develops a new item scale to measure them it also establishes the validity reliability and crosscultural measurement equivalence of the new scale and discusses its advantages over other scales academy of marketing science
considerable extant research demonstrates the benefits of trust in buyerseller relationships more recent research points out downsides of the vulnerability inherent with trust recognizing this dilemma of trust partners may offset the vulnerability of trust with verification strategiesefforts to produce information relevant to the exchange relationship this research examines the use of three types of verification strategiesmonitoring assurances and corroborationwhich may be employed to safeguard against the vulnerability of trust when control mechanisms like trust and information are combined they may complement one another and enhance performance or function as substitutes be redundant or compete and consequently detract from performance emerging theory on combined modes of governance provides insights we draw on this theory and develop hypotheses proposing that combinations of trust and verification may enhance or detract exchange performancedepending on the specific verification strategy the hypotheses are tested on a sample of buyersupplier relationships results of the research provide some support for the proposed relationships and yield implications for the management of cooperative exchange relationships academy of marketing science
although interest regarding gender role portrayals in advertising has persisted for many years the degree of gender stereotyping in advertising possible changes of gender stereotyping over the years and the nature of the relationship between gender stereotyping in advertising and role changing developments in society have not yet been studied in previous research to address these issues this study provides a metaanalysis of the research on gender roles in tv and radio advertising based on primary studies the results show that stereotyping is prevalent in advertising stereotyping occurs mainly related to genders occupational status meaning gender equality in advertising is least likely in an area that is the primary concern of genderrelated politics stereotyping in advertising has indeed decreased over the years although this decrease is almost exclusively due to developments in high masculinity countries the results of a correlation analysis and a simultaneous equation model show that gender stereotyping in advertising depends on genderrelated developments and value changes in society rather than the other way around these results provide for the first time empirical support for the mirror argument over the mold argument in the longstanding debate about advertisings consequences for society the findings further provide implications for researchers public policy makers and marketing practitioners academy of marketing science
consumer exposure to new brand names can occur in contexts with or without brand information being present whereas previous research has examined the effects of brand name characteristics association set size and word frequency on memory in the presence of brand information this paper also assesses brand name effects in contexts without brand related information and extends it to brand consideration and choice two different processes are found to be operating as consumers retrieve brands and make a choice recall seems to benefit from a distinctiveness based route which also guides consideration and choice in contrast implicit memory is influenced by familiarity with corresponding consideration and choice effects the implications are that firms choice of brand names and media needs to consider the combination of brand name characteristics that will lead to desired outcomes visvis distinctiveness or familiarity based processes academy of marketing science
in the present research construal level theory is used to predict that consumers will mentally characterize incentive offers differently as a function of their redemption time frames data from two experiments indicate that concrete features such as the face value of an offer or its mode of presentation as a dollar figure or as a percentage discount are prominent for incentives with short time frames but not for incentives with long ones in the latter case abstract features such as the incentives goal congruity or fit with personal values are more likely to influence responses academy of marketing science
cooperative advertising plays a strategically important role in marketing programs in this paper we use a game theoretical model to study not only cooperative advertising but also pricing strategy in a manufacturereretailer supply chain with the consideration of product categories first two cooperative advertising models the leaderfollower stackelberg and the strategic alliance are established and analyzed we then compare the two models to develop some important theories and managerial insights furthermore we utilize a bargaining model to implement profit sharing and determine the manufacturers participation rate for cooperative advertising in the channel coordination of strategic alliance based on our results we derive optimal market strategies and identify probable paths of future research academy of marketing science
since its introduction as a concept in the s supply chain management scm has undergone significant modification and expansion a qualitative analysis of unique definitions of scm published in the literature identified three major themes associated with the supply chain and scm activities benefits and constituentscomponents utilizing these themes key research questions and issues within the supply chain and scm are identified that could be examined by marketing scholars academy of marketing science
consumer sales promotions are usually the result of the decisions of two marketing channel parties the manufacturer and the retailer in making these decisions each party normally follows its own interest ie maximizes its own profit unfortunately this results in a suboptimal outcome for the channel as a whole independent profit maximization by channel parties leads to a lack of channel coordination with the implication of leaving money on the table this may well contribute to the notoriously low profitability of sales promotions this paper first shows analytically why the suboptimality occurs and then presents an empirical demonstration using a unique dataset from an efficient consumer response ecr project ecr is a movement in which parties work together to optimize the distribution channel in this dataset actual profit is only a small fraction of potential profit implying that there is a large degree of suboptimality it is important that channel parties are aware of this suboptimality and that they have tools to deal with it solutions to the channel coordination problem should ensure that the goals of the individual channel parties are aligned with the goals of the channel as a whole the paper proposes one particular agreement for this purpose called proportional discount sharing application to the ecr data shows a winwin result for both the manufacturer and the retailer recognition of the channel coordination problem by the manufacturer and the retailer is the necessary starting point for agreeing on a way of solving it in a winwin fashion the authors
this study provides deeper insight in the link between service quality and customer satisfaction the traditional assumption of a linear relationship is challenged by exploring asymmetries and dynamics the simultaneous influence of service quality and customer experience on satisfaction is examined by means of nonlinear structural equation modeling results show that functionalutilitarian quality attributes availability efficiency fulfillment and privacy lose their capability to delight customers as the customer relationship matures in contrast hedonic quality attributes design enjoyment and image only exhibit an increasing effect on satisfaction for more experienced customers these insights are vital for service managers as they help to improve the efficiency of quality investments the authors

personal selling is thought to be a very effective marketing vehicle the notion of adaptive selling suggests that it should work better than any other means of communication because salespeople are able to develop a unique message for each customer this research proposes a model of key antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling in particular we distinguish measure and model the attitudinal and behavioral aspects of adaptive selling something that is encouraged but not thoroughly examined in the literature hypotheses are tested using data from salespersoncustomer dyads the results indicate that a salespersons perception of the firms customer orientation has an effect on adaptive selling behavior through the salespersons adaptive selling confidence role ambiguity intrinsic motivation and customerqualification skills adaptive selling behavior increases salespersons outcome performance customers evaluations of satisfaction with the product and with the salesperson which enhance customers anticipation of future interactions with the salesperson the implications for management and theory are discussed academy of marketing science
given that the impact of retail shelf facings and price on a products market share is of substantial interest to marketing managers in the retail supply chain we examine whether these relationships may be interdependent with the firms supply chain activities we offer predictions regarding the interdependence of the marketing and supply chain variables using monthly instore observations from different retail stores from five different chains taken over a month period the instore observations included price and number of facings which is combined with data obtained from the manufacturer on case pack quantity and market share data from the acnielsen homescan consumer scanner panel results indicate that shelf facings impact the effects of price and case pack quantity on market share in addition we explore the strength of relationships across retailers employing everyday low price versus hilo pricing strategies generally our findings suggest that retailers and suppliers must work to integrate marketing activities and supply chain processes both within and across firms to most effectively serve the consumer at the retail shelf and increase market share academy of marketing science
although a potentially significant issue to managers and academics alike opportunistic customer behavior in the service recovery context has been largely ignored a multistage research program comprising actual customer claims study in depth customer interviews study and three experimental studies studies explored opportunistic customer claiming behavior during service recovery and yielded robust findings across methods contexts and samples potential determinants of opportunistic claiming in a service recovery context were identified by drawing on the justice selfconcept maintenance and neutralization theories the findings support the hypothesis that when experiencing lower distributive procedural and interactional justice respondents were more likely to be opportunistic in their claiming further more consumers were more likely to be opportunistic when dealing with large compared to small firms and when they were in onetime transactions compared to when they had an established relationship with the firm finally increased claiming in general and opportunistic claiming in particular did not lead to increased satisfaction with the service recovery academy of marketing science
control and governance theories recognize that exchange partners are subject to two general forms of control the unilateral authority of one firm and bilateral expectations extending from their social bond in this way a supplier both exerts unilateral authoritybased controls and is subject to sociallybased bilateral controls as it attempts to manage its brand successfully through reseller channels such control is being challenged by suppliers growing relative dependence on increasingly dominant resellers in many industries yet the impact of supplier relative dependence on the efficacy of controlbased governance in the suppliers channel is not well understood to address this gap we specify and test a control model moderated by relative dependence involving the conceptualization and measurement of governance at the level of specific control processes incenting monitoring and enforcing our empirical findings show relative dependence undercuts the effectiveness of certain unilateral and bilateral control processes while enhancing the effectiveness of others largely supporting our dual suppositions that each control process operates through a specialized behavioral mechanism and that these underlying mechanisms are differentially impacted by relative dependence we offer implications of these findings for managers and identify our contributions to channel theory and research academy of marketing science
consumer researchers have yet to examine how consumers frame and deal with conflict understanding how consumers manage conflict is essential for service providers seeking to effectively recover instances of service failure and avoid the costs associated with increasing instances of consumer anger using a modified grounded theory approach we develop a model of consumer conflict management drawing on informant accounts of service failures the emergent model proposes that consumers conflict style is related to whether conflict is framed in task or personal terms taskframed conflicts resulted in more productive conflict styles than those framed in personal terms self vs other orientation moderated the relationship between conflict frame and conflict style these findings help us better understand the nature of consumer conflict and identify the importance of carefully targeting service recovery efforts to reduce instances of anger academy of marketing science
a parsimonious framework linking advertising expenditures and research and development expenditures to brand value and brand value in turn to firmlevel financial performance was proposed and empirically investigated under four data conditions data form brand type financial performance metric and lag structure using pooled data from firms firmyear observations over the period path analyses were conducted to compute five path model output metrics data on these metrics were then compared for each of the data conditions by means of analysis of variance although significant relationships were generally observed among framework variables study results differed considerably across three of the four data conditions the principal takeaway from the study is that the impact of marketing activities on firmlevel financial performance is likely to be in large part a function of the specific research purpose and methodology employed as such the takeaway has implications when interpreting valuerelevance findings when constructing theories involving marketbased assets and when designing studies to investigate relationships between marketing and financial performance academy of marketing science
in todays retail markets products display opaque pricing i e a single number that provides no information about the allocation of the retail proceeds among agents who bring the product to market we study transparent pricing which is an alternative strategy in which allocation information is revealed we differentiate transparent pricing from related marketing practices such as social marketing causerelated marketing and paywhatyouwant using controlled experiments in multiple product categories with diverse sampling frames we find that transparent prices systematically alter consumer utility functions and stated choice behavior our results support explanations drawn from both neoclassical and behavioral economic theory including inequity aversion procedural justice and altruism classical theory predicts that price transparency should have little effect on consumer behavior however results from behavioral economics suggest that consumers may relax selfinterest in the face of transparent prices leading to counterintuitive preferences for example in one set of studies we observe a significant proportion of consumers selecting the more expensive of two replicates of the same product in another study a subset of motorists willingly pays higher gasoline taxes for the same gallon of gas increasing the overall price per gallon we explain this behavior via parameterized utility functions that contain both selfinterested and otherinterested components moderated by characteristics of the decisionmaker and characteristics of the choice context academy of marketing science
although firms spend more than billion annually on sales contests no empirical research has investigated the effects of contests on individual customers while some shortterm firm effects of contests have been documented the impact on longterm customer value has remained a matter of speculation this research investigates the longterm customer impact of sales contests by applying the customer value framework we add to previous research that has used customer value of marketing programs by employing the acquired retained and addon framework to segment customers based on their purchase history we develop hypotheses drawing on theories in the buyer behavior customer loyalty and sales management domains by disaggregating the overall customer value into initial and subsequent components we demonstrate a greater longterm value per customer in the retained customer cohort and lower shortterm and longterm value per customer among the two other cohorts acquired and addon customers there is no adverse impact on other drivers of customer value such as customer churn and purchase frequency while our study focuses on individual customer effects we note the significantly higher volume of customers during the contest leads to a positive aggregatelevel assessment we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for managers and researchers academy of marketing science
ad campaigns target consumers with information about the company its products and sometimes its employees ads also reach the organizations employees and may contain information useful to employees in meeting customer needs results from a study involving a hightech firm indicate that when employees believe ads are effective and value congruent their customer focus increases pride completely mediates the effects of value congruence and effectiveness on customer focus organizational identification of employees generally results in a more favorable reaction to ads a second study involving a regional health facility replicates and extends these findings to include employee portrayal accuracy when employees are featured in ads employee portrayal accuracy affects promise accuracy effectiveness and valuecongruence in addition employee portrayal accuracy has a direct effect on customer focus the authors

given the large investments required for highquality complaint handling design managers need practical guidance in understanding its actual importance for their particular company however while prior research emphasizes the general relevance of complaint handling design it fails to provide a more differentiated perspective on this interesting issue this study which is based on an integrative multilevel framework and a dyadic dataset addresses this important gap in research results indicate that the impact of a companys complaint handling design varies significantly depending on the characteristics of the complaining customers with which the firm has to deal further this paper shows that contingent on these characteristics a companys complaint handling design can shape complainants fairness perceptions either considerably or only slightly overall findings suggest that companies should apply an adaptive approach to complaint handling to avoid misallocation of attention energy and resources academy of marketing science
both supply chain management scm and marketing in general have been moving from models and purposes narrowly focused on goods to more general models and purposes associated with partnerships value networks service provision and value creation some of this movement has been captured in what has become known as servicedominant sd logic this article applies sd logic to thinking about scm in terms of service provision in which goods are seen as service distribution or provisioning mechanisms explores and elaborates on the concept of a value network and develops a model of the firm as an essential service provisioning agent in a complex and adaptive value network research and managerial opportunities are also explored academy of marketing science
in this study cognitive evaluation theory illustrates how the controlling aspects of reward redemption policy stringent versus flexible interact with the type of offered reward social versus economic to influence relational program effectiveness we look at effectiveness by defining and measuring relational worth the nonfinancial value of consumers to organizations the hypotheses are empirically tested with a sample of season ticket holders of a professional sports team n and then replicated in a second study with experimental data using scenarios in a hotel reward program context results indicate that perceived social rewards lead to affective commitment while perceived economic rewards lead to continuance commitment involvement is a significant determinant in how reward type and policy influence commitment types specifically lowinvolvement consumers are more influenced by reward program signals than highinvolvement consumers affective commitment produces the most relationally valuable consumer to an organization in terms of relational worth controlling policies have an undermining effect on all commitment types regardless of reward type academy of marketing science
as managers and academics increasingly raise issues about the real value of crm the authors question its direct and unconditional performance effect the study advances research on crm by investigating the role of critical mechanisms underlying the crmperformance link drawing from the sourcespositionsperformance framework the authors build a research model in which two strategic postures of firmsdifferentiation and cost leadershipmediate the effect of crm on firm performance this investigation also contributes to the literature by drawing attention to the differential impact of crm in diverse industry environments the study analyzes data from indepth field interviews and a largescale crossindustry survey and results reveal that crm does not affect firm performance directly rather the crmperformance link is fully mediated by differentiation and cost leadership in addition crms impact on differentiation is greater when industry commoditization is high academy of marketing science
