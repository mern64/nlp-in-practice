    "# Getting started with Word2Vec in Gensim and making it work!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Word2Vec is pretty simple. We are making and assumption that you can tell the meaning of a word by the company it keeps. This is analogous to the saying *show me your friends, and I'll tell who you are*. So if you have two words that have very similar neighbors (i.e. the usage context is about the same), then these words are probably quite similar in meaning or are at least highly related. For example, the words `shocked`,`appalled` and `astonished` are typically used in a similar context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec and actually get it to work! I have heard a lot of complaints about poor performance etc, but its really a combination of two things, (1) your input data and (2) your parameter settings. Note that the training algorithms in this package were ported from the [original Word2Vec implementation by Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and extended with additional functionality."

    "### Dataset \n",
    "Next, is our dataset. The secret to getting Word2Vec really working for you is to have lots and lots of text data. In this case I am going to use data from the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset. This dataset has full user reviews of cars and hotels. I have specifically concatenated all of the hotel reviews into one big file which is about 97MB compressed and 229MB uncompressed. We will use the compressed file for this tutorial. Each line in this file represents a hotel review. You can download the OpinRank Word2Vec dataset here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, while gensim’s word2vec tutorial says that you need to pass it a sequence of sentences as its input, you can always pass it a whole review as a sentence (i.e. a much larger size of text), and it should not make much of a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a closer look at this data below by printing the first line. You can see that this is a pretty hefty review."
