this paper quantifies and aggregates the multiple lifetime benefits of an influential highquality earlychildhood program with outcomes measured through midlife guided by economic theory we supplement experimental data with nonexperimental data to forecast the lifecycle benefits and costs of the program our point estimate of the internal rate of return is with an associated benefitcost ratio of we account for model estimation and forecasting error and present estimates from extensive sensitivity analyses this paper is a template for synthesizing experimental and nonexperimental data using economic theory to estimate the longrun lifecycle benefits of social programs by the university of chicago all rights reserved
a positive demand shock for coltan a mineral whose bulky output cannot be concealed leads armed actors to create illicit customs and provide protection at coltan mines where they settle as stationary bandits a similar shock for gold easy to conceal leads to stationary bandits in the villages where income from gold is spent where they introduce illicit mining visas taxes and administrations having a stationary bandit from a militia or the congolese army increases welfare these findings suggest that armed actors may create essential functions of a state to better expropriate which depending on their goals can increase welfare by the university of chicago
we present results from the first study to examine the causal impact of earlychildhood education on the social preferences of children we compare children who at years old were randomized into either a fulltime preschool a parenting program or a control group we returned to the children when they reached years of age and conducted a series of incentivized experiments to elicit their social preferences we find that earlychildhood education has a strong causal impact on social preferences our findings highlight the importance of taking a broad perspective when designing and evaluating earlychildhood educational programs by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we study how heterogeneity in performance evaluations across supervisors affects employee and supervisor careers and firm outcomes using data on the performance system of a scandinavian service sector firm supervisors vary widely in how they rate subordinates of similar quality in our model this ratings heterogeneity can arise because supervisors can differ in their ability to manage subordinates or in their leniency when rating subordinates furthermore firms might or might not be informed about this heterogeneity the evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity stems in part from real differences in managerial ability that firms are partially informed about by the university of chicago all rights reserved
in a field experiment we examine the impact of performancebased incentives for community college instructors instructor incentives improve student exam scores course grades and credit accumulation while reducing course dropout effects are largest among parttime adjunct instructors during the program instructor incentives have large positive spillovers increasing completion rates and grades in students courses outside our study one year after the program instructor incentives increase transfer rates to year colleges with no impact on year college degrees we find no evidence of complementarities between instructor incentives and student incentives finally while instructors initially prefer gainframed contracts over our lossframed ones preferences for lossframed contracts significantly increase after experience with them by the university of chicago
when is financial repression namely policies that force banks to hold government debt optimal with commitment such policies are never optimal because they crowd out banks productive investments without commitment they are optimal when governments need to issue unusually large amounts of debt such as during wartime in such times repression allows governments to credibly issue more debt repression increases credibility because when banks hold government debt defaults dilute net worth reduce investment and are thus costly ex post forcing banks to hold debt endogenously increases these ex post costs but has ex ante costs because doing so crowds out investments by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we develop a model of gross capital flows and analyze their role in global financial stability in our model consistent with the data when a country experiences asset fire sales foreign investments exit fickleness while domestic investments abroad return home retrenchment when countries have symmetric expected returns and financial development the benefits of retrenchment dominate the costs of fickleness and gross flows increase firesale prices fickleness however creates a coordination problem since it encourages local policy makers to restrict capital inflows when countries are asymmetric capital flows are driven by additional mechanismsreach for safety and reach for yieldthat can destabilize the receiving country by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we introduce a simple model of dynamic matching in networked markets where agents arrive and depart stochastically and the composition of the trade network depends endogenously on the matching algorithm if the planner can identify agents who are about to depart then waiting to thicken the market substantially reduces the fraction of unmatched agents if not then matching agents greedily is close to optimal we specify conditions under which local algorithms that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit the global network structure are close to optimal finally we consider a setting where agents have private information about their departure times and design a mechanism to elicit this information by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we present and empirically implement an equilibrium labor market search model where riskaverse workers facing medical expenditure shocks are matched with firms making health insurance coverage decisions we use our estimated model to evaluate the equilibrium impact of many health care reform proposals including the affordable care act aca we use the estimates of the early impact of the aca as a model validation we find that incomebased subsidies for health insurance premiums are crucial for the sustainability of the aca while the aca can still substantially reduce the uninsured rate without the individual or the employer mandate by the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper investigates whether information about improved public services can help build trust in state institutions and move people away from nonstate actors we find that truthful information about reduced delays in state courts in rural pakistan leads to citizens reporting higher likelihood of using them and to greater allocations to the state in highstakes lab games we also find negative indirect effects on nonstate actors and show that these changes are a response to improved beliefs about state actors which make individuals interact less with nonstate actors and we argue induce them to downgrade their beliefs about these actors by the university of chicago all rights reserved
policy makers have timeinconsistent preferences if they fear losing power or are endowed with hyperbolic discount factors politicians may thus seek to influence future policy choices for example by investing in green technologies that motivate later politicians to act sustainably i show that optimal investment subsidies are larger for technologies that are strategic complements to future investments that are further upstream in the supply chain or that are characterized by longer maturity time inconsistency can rationalize subsidies at similar levels as market failures such as externalities can furthermore the two are superadditive time inconsistency and strategic investments are especially important for longterm policies associated with externalities by the university of chicago all rights reserved
max planck institute for social law and social policy germany we analyze the empirical content of the roy model stripped down to sectorspecific unobserved heterogeneity and selfselection on the basis of potential outcomes we characterize sharp bounds on the joint distribution of potential outcomes and testable implications of the roy model we apply these bounds to derive a measure of departure from roy selfselection so as to identify prime targets for intervention special emphasis is put on the case of binary outcomes we analyze a roy model of college major choice in canada and germany and take a new look at the underrepresentation of women in science technology engineering and mathematics by the university of chicago all rights reserved
there are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the united states and scandinavia to study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences we conducted a largescale international social preference experiment where americans and norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency we show that americans and norwegians differ significantly in fairness views but not in the importance assigned to efficiencywe also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations by the university of chicago all rights reserved
exploiting variation across states and municipalities in the timing and details of midwifery laws introduced during the period and using data assembled from various primary sources we find that requiring midwives to be licensed reduced maternal mortality by and may have led to modest reductions in infant mortality these estimates represent the strongest evidence to date that licensing restrictions can improve the health of consumers and are directly relevant to ongoing policy debates on the merits of licensing midwives by the university of chicago all rights reserved

for many products platforms enable sellers to transact with buyers we show that the competitive conditions among sellers shape the market structure in platform industries if product market competition is tough sellers avoid competitors by joining different platforms this allows platforms to sustain high fees and explains why for example in some online markets several homogeneous platforms segment the market instead if product market competition is soft agglomeration on a single platform emerges and platforms fight for the dominant position these insights give rise to novel predictions for instance market concentration and fees are negatively correlated in platform industries which inverts the standard logic of competition by the university of chicago all rights reserved
stochastic dominance is a crucial tool for the analysis of choice under risk it is typically analyzed as a property of two gambles that are taken in isolationwe study how additional independent sources of risk eg uninsurable labor risk house price risk can affect the ordering of gambles we show that perhaps surprisingly background risk can be strong enough to render lotteries that are ranked by their expectation ranked in terms of firstorder stochastic dominancewe extend our results to secondorder stochastic dominance and show how they lead to a novel and elementary axiomatization of meanvariance preferences by the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper exploits variation in the adoption of copyrights within italy due to the timing of napolons military victories to investigate the causal effects of copyrights on creativity baseline regressions compare changes in opera production across italian states with and without copyrights this analysis yields three main results first the adoption of copyrights led to a significant increase in the number of newly created operas second copyrights raised the quality of new operas measured both by their immediate success and by their longevity third there were no benefits from copyright extensions beyond the life of the original creator by the university of chicago all rights reserved

we study the impact of global food price shocks on local violence across africa in foodproducing areas higher prices reduce conflict over the control of territory factor conflict and increase conflict over the appropriation of surplus output conflict we argue that this difference arises because higher prices increase the opportunity cost of soldiering for producers while simultaneously inducing consumers to appropriate surplus as real wages fall in areas without crop agriculture higher prices increase both forms of conflict we validate our locallevel findings on output conflict using survey data our findings help reconcile a growing but ambiguous literature on the economic roots of conflict by the university of chicago all rights reserved
using employeremployee matched and firm production quantity and input data for portuguese firms we study the endogenous response of productivity to firm reorganizations as measured by changes in the number of management layers we show that as a result of an exogenous demand or productivity shock that makes the firm reorganize and add a management layer quantitybased productivity increases by about while revenuebased productivity drops by around such by the university of chicago all rights reserved

we propose a new framework for optimal experimentation which we term the ab testing problem our model departs from the existing literature by allowing for fat tails our key insight is that the optimal strategy depends on whethermost gains accrue fromtypical innovations or from rare unpredictable large successes if the tails of the unobserved distribution of innovation quality are not too fat the standard approach of using a few highpowered big experiments is optimal however if the distribution is very fat tailed a lean strategy of trying more ideas each with possibly smaller sample sizes is preferred our theoretical results along with an empirical analysis of microsoft bings expplatform suggest that simple changes to business practices could increase innovation productivity by the university of chicago all rights reserved
although an auction of drilling rights is often cited as an example of common values formal evidence has been limited by the problem of auctionlevel unobserved heterogeneity we develop an empirical approach for firstprice sealedbid auctions with affiliated values unobserved heterogeneity and endogenous bidder entry we show that important features of the model are nonparametrically identified and apply a semiparametric estimation approach to data from us offshore oil and gas lease auctions we find that common values affiliated private information and unobserved heterogeneity are all present failing to account for unobserved heterogeneity obscures the evidence of common values we examine implications of our estimates for the interaction between affiliation the winners curse the auction rules and the number of bidders in determining the aggressiveness of bidding and seller revenue by the university of chicago all rights reserved
how does the us labor market absorb lowskilled immigration in the short run highimmigration locations see their lowskilled labor force increase native lowskilled wages decrease and the relative price of rentals increase internal relocation dissipates this shock spatially in the long run the only lasting consequences are a worse labor market conditions for lowskilled natives who entered the labor force in highimmigration years and b lower housing prices in highimmigrant locations when immigrant workers disproportionately enter the construction sector and lower construction costs i use a quantitative dynamic spatial equilibrium manyregion model to obtain the policyrelevant counterfactuals by the university of chicago

we provide microeconomic evidence on ethnic frictions and market efficiency using dyadic data on managers and borrowers from a large indian bank we conjecture that if exposure to religionbased communal violence intensifies intergroup animosity riot exposure will lead to lending decisions that are more sensitive to a borrowers religion we find that riotexposed hindu branch managers lend relatively less to muslim borrowers and that these loans are less likely to default consistent with riot exposure exacerbating tastebased discrimination this bias is persistent across a bank officers tenure suggesting that the economic costs of ethnic conflict are longlasting potentially spanning across generations by the university of chicago
we study contests in which contestants are homogeneous and have convex effort costs increasing contest competitiveness by making prizes more unequal scaling up the competition or adding new contestants always discourages effort these results have significant implications although often criticized as evidence of laxity or cronyism muting competition eg adopting softer grading curves or less highpowered promotion systems can both reduce inequality and increase output holding promotion contests at the division level rather than the firm level can boost employees effort our results are also consistent with personnel policies that feature egalitarian pay systems and dismissal of worstperforming employees by the university of chicago all rights reserved
firm volatilities comove strongly over time and their common factor is the dispersion of the economywide firm size distribution in the cross section smaller firms and firms with a more concentrated customer base display higher volatility network effects are essential to explaining the joint evolution of the empirical firm size and firm volatility distributions we propose and estimate a simple network model of firm volatility in which shocks to customers influence their suppliers larger suppliers have more customers and customersupplier links depend on customers size the model produces distributions of firm volatility size and customer concentration consistent with the data by the university of chicago all rights reserved

using data from duke university undergraduates we make three main contributions to the literature first we show that data on earnings beliefs and probabilities of choosing particular occupations are highly informative of future earnings and occupations second we show how beliefs data can be used to recover ex ante treatment effects and their relationship with individual choices we find large differences in expected earnings across occupations and provide evidence of sorting on expected gains finally nonpecuniary factors play an important role with a sizable share of individuals willing to give up substantial amounts of earnings by not choosing their highestpaying occupation by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we develop a general equilibrium model of asset prices in which benefits of technological innovation are distributed asymmetrically financial market participants do not capture all economic gains from innovation even when they own shares in innovating firms such gains accrue partly to the innovators who cannot sell claims on proceeds from their future ideas we show how the resulting inequality among agents can give rise to a high risk premium on the aggregate stock market return comovement and average return differences among firms and the failure of traditional representative agent asset pricing models to account for crosssectional differences in risk premia by the university of chicago all rights reserved
in this paper we extend gary beckers empirical analysis of the marriage market to samesex couples we build an equilibrium model of the samesex marriage market that allows for straightforward identification of the gains of marriage we estimate the model with american community survey data on california and find that positive assortative mating is weaker for samesex couples than for differentsex couples with respect to age and race positive assortative mating on education is stronger among female samesex couples but comparable for male samesex and differentsex couples as regards labor market outcomes our results suggest that specialization within the household mainly applies to differentsex couples by the university of chicago all rights reserved
a strategic situation with payoffbased externalities is one in which a players payoff depends on her own action and others payoffswe place restrictions on the resulting interdependent utility system that generate a standard normal form referred to as a game of love and hate our central theorem states that every equilibrium of a game of love and hate is pareto optimal while externalities are restricted to flow only through payoffs there are no other constraints they could be positive or negative or of varying sign we examine the philosophical implications of the restrictions that underlie this theorem by the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper introduces a new longrun data set based on archival data from historical waves of the survey of consumer finances studying the joint distribution of household income and wealth we expose the central importance of portfolio composition and asset prices for wealth dynamics in postwar america asset prices shift the wealth distribution because of systematic differences in household portfolios along the wealth distribution middleclass portfolios are dominated by housing while rich households predominantly own business equity differential changes in equity and house prices shaped wealth dynamics in postwar america and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods by the university of chicago

in most us health insurance markets plans face strong incentives to upcode the patient diagnoses they report to the regulator as these affect the riskadjusted payments that plans receive we show that enrollees in private medicare plans generate higher diagnosisbased risk scores than they would under feeforservice medicare where diagnoses do not affect most provider payments our estimates imply that upcoding generates billions in excess public spending and significant distortions to firm and consumer behavior we show that coding intensity increases with vertical integration suggesting a principalagent problem faced by insurers who desire more intense coding from the providers with whom they contract by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we study optimal policy in a businesscycle setting in which firms hold dispersed private information about or are rationally inattentive to the state of the economy the informational friction is the source of both nominal and real rigidity because of the latter the optimal monetary policy does not target price stability instead it targets a negative relation between the nominal price level and real economic activity such leaning against the wind helps maximize production efficiency an additional contribution is the adaptation of the primal approach of the ramsey literature to a flexible form of informational friction by the university of chicago all rights reserved
in the united states hospitals and physicians independently negotiate contracts with insurers therefore a privately insured individual can be treated at an innetwork hospitals emergency department but receive a large unexpected bill from an outofnetwork emergency physician working at that facility because patients do not choose their emergency physician emergency physicians can remain out of network and charge high prices without losing patient volume we illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians bargaining power with insurers we conclude by analyzing new yorks efforts to address outofnetwork billing through binding arbitration between physicians and insurers over outofnetwork payments this intervention reduced outofnetwork billing by percentage points by the university of chicago
political booms measured by the rise in governments popularity predict financial crises above and beyond better known early warning indicators such as credit booms this predictive power however only holds in emerging economies we argue that governments in developing countries have stronger incentives to ride unsound credit booms in order to boost their popularity rather than implementing corrective policies that could prevent crises but are politically costly we provide evidence of the relevance of this mechanism partly by constructing a new crosscountry data set on government popularity based on opinion polls by the university of chicago all rights reserved

we provide microfoundations for dynamic skill formation with a model of investment in multiple skills when jobs place different weights on skills we show that credit constraints may affect investment even when workers do not exhaust their credit firms may invest in their workers skills even when there are many similar competitors firm and worker incentives can lead to overinvestment optimal skill accumulation resembles but is not learning by doing an example shows that shocks to skill productivity benefiting new workers but lowering one skills value may adversely affect even relatively young workers and adjustment may be discontinuous in age by the university of chicago all rights reserved
how global are the gains from innovation when firms operate plants in multiple countries technological improvements developed in one location may be shared with foreign sites for efficiency gain we develop a model that accounts for such transfer and apply it to measure returns to rd investment for a panel of us multinationals our estimates indicate that innovation increases performance at firm locations beyond the innovating site the median multinational firm realizes abroad of the return to its us rd investment revealing a spatial disconnect between the costs and potential gains of policies that encourage multinationals us innovation by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we study the impact of lead exposure from birth to adulthood and provide evidence on the mechanisms producing these effects following children differentially exposed to the phaseout of leaded gasoline in sweden we find that even a low exposure affects longrun outcomes that boys are more affected and that changes in noncognitive skills explain a sizeable share of the impact on crime and human capital the effects are greater above exposure thresholds still relevant for the general population and reductions in exposure equivalent to the magnitude of the recent redefinition of elevated blood lead levels can increase earnings by by the university of chicago
we provide a new estimator for a broad class of equilibrium models of metropolitan housing markets with housing differentiated by quality quality is a latent variable that captures all features of a dwelling and its environment we estimate the model for chicago and new york obtaining hedonic housing price functions for each quality level for each metropolitan area stocks of each quality and compensating variations required for a household of a given income in chicago to be equally well off in new york by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we build a model of the us economy with multiple aggregate shocks that generate fluctuations in equilibrium house prices through counterfactual experiments we study the housing boombust around the great recession with three main results first the main driver of movements in house prices and rents was a shift in beliefs not a change in credit conditions second the boombust in house prices explains half of the corresponding swings in nondurable expenditures through a wealth effect third a largescale debt forgiveness program would have done little to temper the collapse of house prices and expenditures but would have dramatically reduced foreclosures and induced a small but persistent increase in consumption during the recovery by the university of chicago
we study the nonparametric identification of gross output production functions under the environment of the commonly employed proxy variable methods we show that applying these methods to gross output requires additional sources of variation in the demand for flexible inputs eg prices using a transformation of the firms firstorder condition we develop a new nonparametric identification strategy for gross output that can be employed even when additional sources of variation are not available monte carlo evidence and estimates from colombian and chilean plantlevel data show that our strategy performs well and is robust to deviations from the baseline setting by the university of chicago

we develop a model of political cycles driven by timevarying risk aversion agents choose to work in the public or private sector and to vote democratic or republican in equilibrium when risk aversion is high agents elect democrats the party promising more redistribution the model predicts higher average stock market returns under democratic presidencies explaining the wellknown presidential puzzle the model can also explain why economic growth has been faster under democratic presidencies in the data democratic voters are more risk averse and risk aversion declines during democratic presidencies public workers vote democratic while entrepreneurs vote republican as the model predicts by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we develop a new method to measure ceo behavior in large samples via a survey that collects highfrequency highdimensional diary data and a machine learning algorithm that estimates behavioral types applying this method to ceos in six countries reveals two types leaders who do multifunction highlevel meetings and managers who do individual meetings with core functions firms that hire leaders perform better and it takes three years for a new ceo to make a difference structural estimates indicate that productivity differentials are due to mismatches rather than to leaders being better for all firms by the university of chicago all rights reserved
womens reluctance to negotiate is often used to explain the gender wage gap popularizing the push for women to lean in and negotiate more examining an environment in which women achieve positive profits when they choose to negotiate we find that increased negotiations are not helpful women know when to ask they enter negotiations resulting in positive profits and avoid negotiations resulting in negative profits while the findings are similar for men we find no evidence that men are more adept than women at knowing when to ask thus our results caution against a greater push for women to negotiate by the university of chicago all rights reserved
casasarce and saiz study how gender quotas in candidate lists affect voting behavior using evidence fromthe introduction of quotas in the spanish local elections in municipalities with more than inhabitants using a differenceindifferences strategy they show that parties that listed fewer female candidates in the previous election obtained more votes in the subsequent election in larger municipalities a pattern that they attribute to the quotawe show robustness and placebo tests suggesting that the quota did not have an economically or statistically significant impact on voting behavior by the university of chicago all rights reserved
how do shocks to the banking sector travel through the corporate economy using a novel data set of interfirm sales i show that suppliers exposed to a large and exogenous decline in bank financing pass this liquidity shock to their downstream customers the spillover effect occurs through two channels a reduction in trade credit offered and a reduction in the total supply of goods and services after exposure to the spillover downstream customers show a spike in credit risk and a reduction in employment overall the paper highlights the importance of financial spillovers in explaining corporate sector outcomes by the university of chicago
in many settings decision makers behavior is observed to vary on the basis of seemingly arbitrary factors such framing effects cast doubt on the welfare conclusions drawn from revealedpreference analysis we relax the assumptions underlying that approach to accommodate settings in which framing effects are present plausible restrictions of varying strength permit either partial or point identification of preferences for the decision makers who choose consistently across frames recovering population preferences requires understanding the empirical relationship between decision makers preferences and their sensitivity to the frame we develop tools for studying this relationship and illustrate them with data on automatic enrollment into pension plans by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we study the relationship between firms output quality and organizational structure using data on the production and transaction chain that makes up peruvian fish meal manufacturing we establish three results first firms integrate suppliers when the quality premium rises for exogenous reasons second suppliers change their behavior to better maintain input quality when vertically integrated third firms produce a higher share of highquality output when weather and supplier availability shocks shift them into using integrated suppliers overall our results indicate that quality upgrading is an important motive for integrating suppliers facing a quantityquality tradeoff as classical theories of the firm predict by the university of chicago
this article proposes definitions of lying deception and damage in strategic settings lying depends on the existence of accepted meanings for messages but does not require a model of how the audience responds to messages deception does require a model of how the audience interprets messages but does not directly refer to consequences damage requires consideration of the consequences of messages lies need not be deceptive deception does not require lying lying and deception are compatible with equilibrium i give conditions under which deception must be damaging by the university of chicago all rights reserved
using a simple bargaining game we investigate how strategic interactions are shaped by preferences technology and endowments we study whether changes in relative military capabilities make conflicts more likely and find a nonmonotonic relationship between the cost of conflict and the probability of conflict the game has strategic complements if the cost of conflict is small and there is a large firstmover advantage and has strategic substitutes otherwise this characterization generates predictions regarding the use of strategic investments for example in defense systems an extension of the model shows how expanding ones territory today may increase the risk of conflict tomorrow by the university of chicago
people often forget and sometimes fantasize this paper reports a largescale experiment on memory errors and their relation to preferential traits including time preference attitudes toward risk and ambiguity and psychological characteristics such as anticipatory feelings we observe systematic incidences of false memory in favor of positive events and positive amnesia in forgetting past negative events both positive delusion and positive confabulation significantly relate to present bias but this is not the case for positive amnesia in an intraperson multipleself model we demonstrate that positive false memory rather than selective amnesia serves to enhance confidence in ones future self in equilibrium thereby accounting for our experimental findings by the university of chicago all rights reserved
in recent decades democratic countries have negotiated hundreds of international treaties and agreements this paper analyzes the equilibrium design of treaties negotiated by political incumbents seeking reelection we show that incumbents are prone to negotiate treaties that are weak in that they may or may not be complied with this makes it possible to differentiate the alternative candidates in a way that favors the incumbent we also show that political economy considerations lead to overambitious treaties that rely too much on technology instead of sanctions to motivate compliance our theory can rationalize several puzzles associated with treaties by the university of chicago all rights reserved
a principal faces an agent who is better informed but biased toward higher actions she can verify the agents information and specify his permissible actionswe show that if the verification cost is small enough a threshold with an escape clause tec is optimal the agent either chooses an action below a threshold or requests verification and the efficient action above the threshold for higher costs however the principal may require verification only for intermediate actions dividing the delegation set tec is always optimal if the principal cannot commit to inefficient allocations following the verification decision and result by the university of chicago all rights reserved
almost half of missing women in india are of postreproductive ages can intrahousehold gender inequality and asymmetry in poverty explain a portion of these missing women using a natural experiment i link womens intrahousehold bargaining power to their mortality risk using a structural household model i estimate the age profile of womens bargaining power and construct womens relative poverty rates i find that womens bargaining power declines with age with older womens poverty rates closely matching their mortality rates by age this suggests that many missing women might be accounted for by measuring poverty at the individual rather than the household level by the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper illustrates how one can deduce preference from observed choices when attention is both limited and random we introduce a random attention model where we abstain from any particular attention formation and instead consider a large class of nonparametric random attention rules our intuitive condition monotonic attention captures the idea that each consideration set competes for the decision makers attention we then develop a revealed preference theory and obtain testable implications we propose econometric methods for identification estimation and inference for the revealed preferences finally we provide a generalpurpose software implementation of our estimation and inference results and simulation evidence by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we develop a dynastic human capital investment framework to study the importance of family borrowing constraints and uninsured labor market risk as well as the process of intergenerational ability transmission in determining human capital investments in children at different ages we calibrate our model to data from the children of the national longitudinal survey of youth while the effects of relaxing any borrowing limit at a single stage are modest eliminating all lifecycle borrowing limits dramatically increases investments earnings and intergenerational mobility the impacts of policy changes at collegegoing ages are greater when anticipated earlier and shifting subsidies to earlier ages increases aggregate welfare and human capital by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we study information as an incentive device in a dynamic moral hazard framework an agent works on a task of uncertain difficulty modeled as the duration of required effort the principal knows the task difficulty and provides information over time the optimal mechanism features moving goalposts an initial disclosure makes the agent sufficiently optimistic that the task is easy if the task is indeed difficult the agent is told this only after working long enough to put the difficult task within reach the agent then completes the difficult task even though he never would have chosen to at the outset by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we show that genetic endowments linked to educational attainment strongly and robustly predict wealth at retirement the estimated relationship is not fully explained by flexibly controlling for education and labor income we therefore investigate a host of additional mechanisms that could account for the genewealth gradient including inheritances mortality risk preferences portfolio decisions beliefs about the probabilities of macroeconomic events and planning horizons we provide evidence that genetic endowments related to human capital accumulation are associated with wealth not only through educational attainment and labor income but also through a facility with complex financial decisionmaking by the university of chicago all rights reserved
older wealth holders spend down assets much more slowly than predicted by classic lifecycle models this paper introduces healthdependent utility into a model with incomplete markets in which preferences for bequests expenditures when in need of longterm care and ordinary consumption combine with health and longevity uncertainty by the university of chicago all rights reserved
the great recession saw sharp drops in labor earnings and even larger declines in asset prices how were the welfare losses from these declines distributed across different age groups to address this question we construct an overlappinggenerations general equilibrium model in which households face large aggregate shocks a calibrated version of the model replicates observed dynamics for asset prices younger households experience larger earnings losses in a model great recession but benefit from being able to buy assets at temporarily depressed prices as a result the model predicts that the young experience smaller welfare losses than older cohorts by the university of chicago all rights reserved
the great recession was a deep downturn with longlasting effects on credit employment and outputwhile narratives about its causes abound the persistence of gross domestic product below precrisis trends remains puzzlingwe propose a simple persistencemechanismthat can be quantified and combined with existingmodelsour key premise is that agents do not know the true distribution of shocks but use data to estimate it nonparametricallythen transitory events especially extreme ones generate persistent changes in beliefs andmacro outcomes embedding this mechanismin a neoclassical model we find that it endogenously generates persistent drops in economic activity after tail events by the university of chicago
many markets are syndicated including those for initial public offerings club deal leveraged buyouts and debt issuances in such markets each winning bidder invites competitors to join a syndicate to complete production we show that in syndicated markets collusion may become easier as market concentration falls and market entry may facilitate collusion in particular firms can sustain collusion by refusing to syndicate with any firm that undercuts the collusive price thereby raising that firms production costs our results can thus rationalize the paradoxical empirical observations that many realworld syndicated markets exhibit seemingly collusive pricing despite low levels of market concentration by the university of chicago all rights reserved
candidate debates have a rich history and remain integral to contemporary campaign strategy there is however little evidence that they affect the behavior of voters or politicians the scarcity of political information in the developing world offers an attractive testing ground using experimental variation in sierra leone we find that public debate screenings build political knowledge that changes the way people vote which induces a campaign expenditure response by candidates and fosters accountability pressure over the spending of elected officials results show how political communication can trigger a chain of events that begins with voters and ultimately influences policy by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we develop a dynamic limit pricing model where an incumbent repeatedly signals information relevant to a potential entrants expected profitability the model is tractable with a unique equilibrium under refinement and dynamics contribute to large equilibrium price changes we show that the model can explain why incumbent airlines cut prices dramatically on routes threatened with entry by southwest presenting new reducedform evidence and a calibration that predicts a pattern of price changes across markets similar to the one observed in the data we use our calibrated model to quantify the welfare effects of asymmetric information and subsidies designed to encourage southwests entry by the university of chicago all rights reserved
using a random judge design and panel data from norway we estimate that imprisonment discourages further criminal behavior with reoffense probabilities falling by percentage points and criminal charges dropping by over a year period ordinary least squares mistakenly reaches the opposite conclusion the decline is driven by individuals not working prior to incarceration these individuals increase participation in employment programs and raise their future employment and earnings previously employed individuals experience lasting negative employment effects these findings demonstrate that time spent in prison with a focus on rehabilitation can be preventive for a large segment of the criminal population by the university of chicago all rights reserved
this paper studies the supply of and demand for moral values in recent us presidential elections using a combination of largescale survey data and text analyses i find support for the hypothesis that both voters and politicians exhibit heterogeneity in their emphasis on universalist relative to communalmoral values and that politicians vote shares partly reflect the extent to which their moral appeal matches the values of the electorateover the last decade americans values have become increasingly communal especially in rural areas which generated increased moral polarization and is associated with changes in voting patterns across space by the university of chicago all rights reserved
a principal decides when to exercise a real option a biased agent influences this decision by strategically disclosing information committing to disclose all information with a delay is the optimal way to persuade the principal to wait without dynamic commitment this promise is credible only if the agents bias is small otherwise he pipets information probabilistically delaying the principals action when the agent is biased toward early exercise his lack of commitment to remain quiet leads to immediate disclosure hurting him our model applies to pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials to influence the food and drug administration or equipment manufacturers testing their products by the university of chicago all rights reserved
how much should society be willing to pay for reducing inequality the standard approach to this normative question relates inequality aversion to risk aversion by treating inequality as an outcome of a lottery however in the presence of heterogeneous risk preferences it is unclear whose preferences should be used for evaluating this lottery this paper derives a social welfare function as a limit of an iterative procedure in which each iteration constructs a lottery based on the certainty equivalents from the previous iteration the limit of this procedure can be interpreted as the equally distributed equivalent of the initial allocation by the university of chicago all rights reserved
we analyze a bilateral trade model where the buyer chooses the distribution of her valuation for the good the seller after observing the buyers distribution but not the realized valuation makes a takeitorleaveit offer if distributions are costless the price and the payoffs of both the buyer and the seller are shown to be e in the unique equilibrium outcome the buyers equilibrium distribution generates a unitelastic demand and trade is ex post efficient these properties are shown to be preserved even when different distributions are differentially costly as long as the cost is monotone in the dispersion of the distribution by the university of chicago all rights reserved
the interaction of worsening fundamentals and strategic complementarities among investors renders identification of selffulfilling runs challenging we propose a dynamic model to show how exogenous variation in firms liability structures can be exploited to obtain variation in the strength of strategic complementarities applying this identification strategy to puttable securities offered by us life insurers we find that at least of the billion run on life insurers by institutional investors during the crisis was amplified by selffulfilling expectations our findings suggest that other contemporaneous runs in shadow banking by institutional investors may have had a selffulfilling component by the university of chicago
billions of dollars have been spent on pilot programs searching for ways to reduce health care costs i study one such program in which hospitals pay doctors bonuses for reducing the total hospital costs of admitted medicare patients doctors respond to the bonuses by becoming more likely to admit patients whose treatment can generate high bonuses and sorting healthier patients into participating hospitals conditional on patient health however doctors do not reduce costs or change procedure use these results highlight the ability of doctors to game incentive schemes and the risks of basing nationwide health care reforms on pilot programs by the university of chicago all rights reserved
do states experience more peace under female leadership we examine this question in the context of europe over the fifteenth to twentieth centuries we use gender of the firstborn and presence of a sister among previous monarchs as instruments for queenly rule we find that polities led by queens engaged in war more than polities led by kings while single queens were more likely to be attacked than single kings married queens were more likely to attack than married kings these results suggest asymmetries in the division of labor married queens were more inclined to enlist their spouses in helping them rule which enabled them ultimately to pursue more aggressive war policies by the university of chicago all rights reserved

for a searchtheoretic model of the labor market we seek conditions for the existence of a balanced growth path bgp where unemployment vacancy and workers transitions rates remain constant in the face of improvements in the production and search technologies a bgp exists iff firmworker matches are inspection goods and the quality of a match is drawn from a pareto distribution declining search frictions contribute to growth with an intensity determined by the tail coefficient of the pareto distribution we develop a strategy to measure the rate of decline of search frictions and their contribution to growth by the university of chicago all rights reserved
our new model of consumptionbased habit generates timevarying risk premia on bonds and stocks from loglinear homoskedastic macroeconomic dynamics consumers firstorder condition for the real riskfree bond generates an exactly loglinear consumption euler equation commonly assumed in new keynesian models we estimate that the correlation between inflation and the output gap switched from negative to positive in higher inflation lowers real bond returns and higher output raises stock returns which explains why the bondstock return correlation changed from positive to negative in the model risk premia amplify this change in bondstock return comovement and are crucial for a quantitative explanation by the university of chicago all rights reserved
the efficiency of publicly subsidized privately provisioned social insurance programs depends on the interaction between strategic insurers and the subsidy mechanism we study this interaction in the context of medicares prescription drug coverage programwe find that the observed mechanism is successful in keeping raisethesubsidy incentives relatively low acts much like a flat voucher and obtains a level of welfare close to that for the optimal voucher across a range of counterfactuals we find that more efficient subsidy mechanisms share three features they retain the marginal elasticity of demand limit the exercise of market power and preserve the link between prices and marginal costs by the university of chicago all rights reserved

i analytically characterize the longrun behavior of an economy with two types of agents who differ in their beliefs and are endowed with homothetic recursive preferences agents with more incorrect beliefs dominate or agents with different accuracy of their beliefs coexist in the long run for broad ranges of plausible parameterizations when risk aversion is greater than the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution the results highlight a crucial interaction between risk sharing speculative behavior and consumptionsaving choice of agents with heterogeneous beliefs and the role of equilibrium prices in shaping longrun outcomes by the university of chicago
we study merger policy in a dynamic computational model in which firms can reduce costs through investment or through mergers firms invest or propose mergers according to the profitability of these strategies an antitrust authority can block mergers at some cost we examine the optimal policy for an antitrust authority that cannot commit to its future policy and approves mergers as they are proposed we find that the optimal policy can differ substantially from a policy based on static welfare in general antitrust policy can greatly affect firms investment behavior and firms investment behavior can greatly affect the optimal antitrust policy by the university of chicago
the absence of a trend in hours worked in the postwar united states is an exception across countries and historically hours fall steadily by a little below per year are steadily falling hours consistent with a stable utility function over consumption and leisure under balanced growth of the macroeconomic aggregates yes we fully characterize the class of such functions and thus generalize the wellknown balancedgrowth preferences that demand constant as opposed to falling longrun hours key to falling hours is an income effect of steady productivity growth on hours that slightly outweighs the substitution effect by the university of chicago
in online procurement markets projects are often allocated through a mechanism that allows buyers to take into account a sellers nonprice characteristics as well as his bid we design a methodology to recover primitives of the environment in the presence of unobserved seller heterogeneity while accommodating two important features of such markets buyerspecific choice sets and the high turnover of sellers we apply our method to data from an online market for programming services to assess buyers welfare gains associated with the globalization enabled by the internet we find that the internet enables buyers to substantially improve on their outside local option many of the gains arise from access to the international markets by the university of chicago

the united states and japan have been involved in trade frictions over a number of products including textiles steel automobiles semiconductors and agricultural products over the last years usjapan trade frictions have taken basically two forms i the united states attempting to restrict japans exports to the united states and ii the united states attempting to increase its exports to japan by opening the japanese market by putting pressure on japan to adopt necessary measures the united states sought to achieve two main objectives i to reduce its trade deficit visvis japan and ii to protect andor promote us industries the united states failed to achieve the first objective while some success was achieved for the second objective the united states triggered a trade war against china with the objectives of i reducing the bilateral trade deficit and ii stopping unfair trade practices by chinese firms such as violations of intellectual property rights and forced technology transfer based on the experiences from the usjapan trade frictions the united states may achieve some success for the second objective but not for the first the chances of achieving the second objective would increase if the united states cooperates with countries such as japan and the european union which are faced with similar problems japan center for economic research
after three decades of rapid economic growth during the authoritarian soeharto era followed by the deep but relatively shortlived asian financial crisis indonesia transitioned rapidly to democratic and decentralized governance we examine policymaking processes and economic outcomes during the first two decades of this new era leading up to the national elections where it was widely conjectured that indonesia might follow the global trends of authoritarian rule and illiberalism we conclude that thus far indonesia has navigated the transition from authoritarian to democratic rule quite successfully compared to the soeharto era growth has been somewhat slower inequality has risen and policy reform is slower and generally incremental but living standards continue to rise and all major political players have elected to operate within the new democratic parameters macroeconomic management has continued to be effective nevertheless there are no grounds for complacency there is a large outstanding reform agenda and the economy is not providing enough economic opportunities for the bettereducated senior secondary and tertiary graduates entering the workforce japan center for economic research
we evaluate the impact of the uschina trade war using a dynamic computable general equilibrium cge model of global trade we conduct ex ante simulation analysis exploring three scenarios to understand how the trade war affects import tariffs investment and productivity the escalation of the trade war reduces gross domestic product gdp in china and the usa by and respectively the trade war reduces nearly all sectoral imports and outputs in both countries to reflect the important role of global value chains gvcs we modify the dynamic cge model with agentspecific import demands and we explore the difference between the results for the two models relating to the trade war impacts on gdp and bilateral trade when gvcs are accounted for the negative impacts on bilateral trade are more widespread across countries and world gdp in the modified model is reduced by us billion these results suggest that the gvcs play substantial role in determining trade responses at the disaggregated level japan center for economic research
this paper argues how the features of vietnams politicaladministrative system and their recent changes have affected economic reform particularly reform of stateowned enterprises after the th party congress in the party secretary general nguyen phu trongs administration has seemed to exaggerate its conservative and totalitarianlooking rule in the political arena in contrast the economic reform policies introduced by trongs administration seem more transformative and progressive this paper suggests that this contradiction must indicate changes in the policies relating to the state management of economic entities andor a disguised form of reform to retain state influence over economic management both of which tend to end up with pervasive rentseeking practices japan center for economic research

this paper investigates the effects on and responses of five middleincome southeast asian economies to the current global environment of authoritarian populism the retreat from economic liberalism and the appeal of antiglobalization movements while the political histories and institutional capabilities of the five indonesia malaysia philippines thailand and vietnam vary greatly these economies have a history of at least moderately fast economic growth for extended periods and of increasing regional and global economic integration we argue that most of the factors behind the discontent with globalization in the rich economies are not present to the same degree in these countries and that there has therefore been no major retreat from the economic policy settings that have underpinned their past economic success however there are no grounds for complacency economic growth is slowing in some of the countries economic insecurity remains widespread and the development of durable independent institutions has lagged economic growth japan center for economic research
what precisely were the causes and consequences of the trade wars in the s were there perhaps deeper forces at work in reorienting global trade prior to the outbreak of world war ii and what lessons may this particular historical episode provide for the present day to answer these questions we distinguish between longrun secular trends in the period from to related to the formation of trade blocs and shortrun disruptions associated with the trade wars of the s we argue that the trade wars mainly served to intensify preexisting efforts toward the formation of trade blocs which dated from at least more speculatively we argue that the trade wars of the present day may serve a similar purpose as those in the s that is the intensification of china and uscentric trade blocs the authors asian economic policy review published by john wiley sons australia ltd on behalf of japan center for economic research

this paper uses usa countylevel electoral data to examine the turn to protectionism the hypothesis that support for protectionism was purely a response to globalization is rejected exposure to trade competition encouraged a shift to the republican candidate but this effect is mediated by race diversity education and age if the turn toward protectionism is due to economic dislocation then public policy interventions could mitigate the impact and support the reestablishment of a political consensus for open trade if however the drivers are identity or cultural values then the scope for constructive policy intervention is unclear japan center for economic research
in this paper we investigated the economic effects of zoning regulations on the retail industry in korea we estimated the changes in the number of sales for retail stores using a panel regression analysis for stores in traditional markets this analysis was conducted to examine the benefit of zoning regulations on retail stores our results show that the zoning regulations called traditional commercial activity protection zones have contributed to an improvement in the actual business performance of small independent retailers we found that the amount of sales for each store clearly increased on average in the areas designated as traditional commercial activity protection zones where there was no market entry of mega supermarket chains called ssm in korea we also present evidence that the effects of this policy differ geographically the effects were stronger for small and medium cities than for large metropolitan cities these results suggest that zoning regulations enacted by the government to protect traditional markets and small retailers should also consider regional differences when assessing policy effectiveness east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd

the growth of zombie firms has caused increasing concern the present study seeks to understand why zombie firms have been emerging in recent years and to further explore the mechanisms of their formation based on a dataset of chinese listed companies from to and empirical analysis the present study ascribes the prevalence of zombie firms to soft budget constraints after using a modified identification model in the chinese context we concluded that zombie firms have access to some external resources such as credit support from banks and governmental subsidies substantiating soft budget constraints among zombie firms to explain this phenomenon further analysis reveals that zombie firms bear a heavier policy burden by hiring excess employees which will bring them more subsidies and a stronger relationship with government in return this result indicates that policy burden is the reason for soft budget constraints which exacerbates the zombie firm problems in china east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
this study examines the influence of trade liberalization on income distribution among different household groups in vietnam using the dynamic computable general equilibrium cge framework to accomplish this objective we developed a multisector multihousehold dynamic cge model and the corresponding social accounting matrix for vietnam our simulation results show that in the long run all household groups can enjoy an improvement in their welfare because the increase in the budget for consumption of all groups is large enough to outweigh the negative effect of changes in consumption prices we also find that while trade liberalization is positively associated with economic growth and national welfare it also increases the income disparities between rich and poor households between rural and urban areas and among rural people as well as among urban people east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd

this paper examines consumption risk sharing among regions in south korea over the period the empirical results show that percent of shocks to gross regional domestic product are smoothed in south korea capital markets the taxtransfer system and credit markets absorb and percent of shocks to gross regional domestic product respectively most notably south korea relies more on credit markets for risk sharing than capital markets an opposite pattern to advanced countries like the usa canada and australia furthermore the patterns of consumption risk sharing are different before and after the global financial crisis and differences in regional industrial structure and local development can influence these patterns this paper attempts to infer the connection between these findings and both the rapid economic growth of south korea and the asian and global financial crises east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
there has been a perennial debate on why the informal economy exists and grows in developing countries around the world the present study focuses on the case of thailand one of the countries with the highest share of informal activities to clarify whether its informal workers participate in the informal sector voluntarily or involuntarily the confirmation matters for the design of government policies and public welfare we separated the study into two levels first at the national level we used the finite mixture model to examine the population and housing census and estimate the wage equations for formal voluntary informal and involuntary informal workers second we focused on a local area for the case of chiang mai city where we surveyed a sample of informal business owners to understand their decision to participate in the informal sector from both levels of study we found heterogeneity among the informal workers who could be classified into voluntary and involuntary groups while those in the voluntary group stay in the informal sector because workers prefer time flexibility those in the involuntary group stay because of family burdens both levels of data also showed that the thai informal sector is dominated by the voluntary group percent east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
this study examined the difference between male and female groups return on investment roi in education independent of the average gender wage gap womens additional roi in education was significant and positively estimated furthermore the roi in womens education was consistently higher than that in men regardless of educational stage except for graduate education these gender differences were greater in the younger generation than in the older generation and have decreased significantly in the recent ten years in high school education although the additional roi in womens education was positive in the field of culture and arts educations effect on wage increases in professional occupations was less than in men especially in the fields of law and medicine in addition we show that gender differences in roi in education were countercyclical a base effect large wage declines for loweducated women during recessions could explain this phenomenon however coinciding with the existence of positive cash flow news in the stock market that promises good business performance a significant wage increase among highly educated women was found east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
from the perspective of behavioral economics this study uses a scenario simulation experiment and the orderedprobit econometric model to empirically analyze the influence of egoistic and altruistic bequest motives of the elderly on willingness to participate in reverse mortgages the findings are as follows i when controlling for the demographic characteristics of the elderly the marginal probability of their willingness to participate in reverse mortgages is influenced by two constraints the egoistic bequest motive and the altruistic bequest motive however compared with the egoistic bequest motive the altruistic bequest motive more strongly affects such willingness ii improving satisfaction with community oldage services can significantly weaken the effects of the egoistic bequest motive on the willingness to participate in reverse mortgages generally by weakening dependence on family oldage care however property tax implementation can significantly reduce the constraint effects of altruistic bequest motives on such willingness mainly by affecting the cost of housing inheritance to the children iii to increase demand for reverse mortgages financial institutions should constantly innovate and optimize the operation modes of reverse mortgages to more efficiently cope with the influence of egoistic and altruistic bequest motives of the elderly government departments should continuously promote property tax reform and improve the quality of community services for the aged to indirectly promote willingness to participate in reverse mortgages east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
this paper investigates a pattern of price revision by firms in korea and sheds light on the cause of price stickiness by providing reliable statistical estimates for calibration of the parameters of the widelyused macromodels based on firmlevel survey data and using a probit model we identify the firm characteristics or market conditions that discourage firms from carrying out statedependent price adjustment we also estimate the factors driving firms to engage in statedependent adjustment rather than wait until the next scheduled revision under three different shocks demand general cost and exchange rate shocks we find a few interesting features as follows first price revision by korean firms tends to be timedependent rather than statedependent with a sizable dispersion across sectors and firm sizes second the pattern of price revision in korea is not significantly different from that in selected advanced economies third the reason why firms favor timedependent price adjustments appears to be endogenous accounted for by a number of market institution variables fourth in response to shocks korean firms tend to wait until the next periodically scheduled revision rather than make a statedependent price adjustment unless marginal costs are affected significantly by the shock and statedependent revisions are often significantly delayed when they do occur east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd

in this paper we explore the possible policy responses to the covid pandemic shock as well as the related economic financial crisis shocks on trade and global value chains gvc in east asia we find that regional policy coordination is critical to mitigate and isolate the pandemic shock it is important to identify the pandemic events early to flatten the pandemic curve at the national and regional level this supports a recent study by the world bank which highlights the importance of early mitigation policies during the pandemic shock the cost of the pandemic and economic shocks will increase significantly when several countries in the region experience the pandemic shock concurrently in this case flattening the regional pandemic curve becomes important the results also indicate the need for greater coordination in east asia to mitigate the pending economic shock in terms of unemployment corporate bankruptcy and financial market fragility the paper also highlights that the stability of the gvc network is critical during the pandemic in terms of hedging the risk of disruptions to the procurement of critical medical and health products as well as maintaining service linkages to manufacturing such as the logistics sector regional policy coordination and the stability of gvc will be valuable in the postpandemic recovery of the region east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
this study investigated consumers valuation of geographical indication gi and protected geographical indication pgilabeled rice in bangkok using a nonhypothetical experimental auction in a field setting we also examined the effects of sequentially providing information about geographical indications on product valuation the results suggest that consumers are willing to pay premiums for rice with geographical certifications with the highest premium for the rice with both gi and pgi certifications the provision of detailed information about the geographical indications further increases the premiums however consumers suffer a welfare loss under the current high market prices for rice with geographical certifications a price reduction of approximately percent would be needed to gain consumer welfare from the introduction of gi and pgi certification east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
there is a continuing debate on the measurement of living standards especially in developing countries the proliferation of social indicators in recent decades motivated by both philosophical and pragmatic empirical considerations has been illuminating however it has also led to some confusion which indicator or set of indicators should be used the most widely used indicator continues to be headcount poverty or some refined variant of it however what of the many other indicators and importantly do they portray a similar picture we illustrate these issues with reference to the indonesian experience over several decades indonesia has experienced moderately fast economic growth since the late s and as a consequence headcount poverty has fallen rapidly most other social indicators have also improved however the rate of progress has varied from similarly rapid improvement to stagnation and in one instance environmental amenities to regression east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd
using a panel dataset for the period of the present paper explores the significant determinants that indicate the likelihood of bankruptcy for chaebol and nonchaebol firms in korea and identifies the differences in the determinants between the two types of firms with an emphasis on their ownership and financial structures logit bankruptcy regressions show that largest shareholder ownership ie ownership concentration is likely to act as a corporate governance mechanism in reducing bankruptcy risk and that financial stability operating experience and firm size are also important in separate regressions for chaebol and nonchaebol firms foreign ownership for chaebol firms and ownership concentration for nonchaebol firms emerge as significantly positive and negative bankruptcy determinants respectively in particular bank ownership is identified as a positive factor for chaebol firms and a negative factor for nonchaebol firms these outcomes suggest that ownership concentration and bank ownership are likely to play a monitoring role in lowering bankruptcy risk for nonchaebol firms outcomes from more elaborate estimations also suggest that overall bank ownership enhances the monitoring role as a substitute for low foreign ownership east asian economic association and john wiley sons australia ltd

both the efficient market hypothesis and modern portfolio theory rest on the assumptions of the gaussian probability distribution and independence of consecutive returns this paper provides a brief excursion into the history of capital market research a measure of longrange dependence hurst exponent was applied to daily returns of selected stock indices and individual firms the hurst exponent was estimated using rescaled range analysis the estimates are based on an unusually large sample of empiricaltime series from capital markets this method distinguishes whether the datagenerating process follows random walk or exhibits antipersistent or persistent behavior both the efficient market hypothesis and modern portfolio theory assume that the datagenerating process has no memory ie follows brownian motion the random walk process is characterized by a hurst exponent value of values greater than and less than indicate a persistence of local trends values between and indicate a process that reverts to the mean more often than a random process meanreverting process the results indicated that the series of daily returns exhibit predominantly persistent or antipersistent behavior therefore brownian motion cannot be perceived as the norm for describing stock market behavior these findings challenge the assumption of a random walk in stock prices valuation models and assessment of risk international atlantic economic society
this research has two goals to measure the extent of assortative nonrandom mating by college major in the united states and to assess the extent to which assortative mating by college major increases earnings inequality among collegeeducated couples assortative mating of college graduates with other college graduates has been extensively studied but research on assortative mating by field of study is rare the analysis uses a large sample couples from five years of the american community survey public use files to group college degrees into nine categories compute the frequency of all marital pairings and compare these frequencies to a random assignment of pairings the results show that assortative mating by college major is common for all majors and both genders and that these results are robust to division of the sample by age group because highearning majors tend to be married to spouses from the same highearning major group and likewise for lowearning majors assortative mating increases earnings inequality among twoearner collegeeducated couples the extent of this increased earnings inequality is calculated with both dollar measures and standard aggregate measures of inequality thus collegeeducated americans tend to marry persons with similar college majors and this tendency measurably increases earnings inequality among collegeeducated couples international atlantic economic society
this paper models a consumer loan market with a vertical structure where an upstream monopolist supplies funds to downstream nonbanks the nonbanks supply funds to consumers in the consumer loans market an inverse demand function of the consumer is linear the downstream nonbank freely enters the market as long as it earns a positive profit first this paper derives freeentry equilibrium without government regulation next this paper examines the effects of government regulation on the entry of nonbanks two regulatory schemes are investigated partial regulation wherein the government can only control the interest rate the monopolist sets and full regulation wherein the government can control the number of nonbanks as well as the interest rate this paper presents four new results first downstream firms insufficiently enter the market under partial regulation second downstream firms excessively enter the market under full regulation third the establishment of the upstream public firm improves welfare even though its profit is negative under partial regulation fourth full regulation is welfare improving compared to partial regulation international atlantic economic society
this paper presents a new rationalization for bailouts of sovereign debt in monetary unions such as those observed during the recent euro crisis it introduces a model where member countries of the monetary union are exante identical and each derives utility from consumption and disutility from the unionwide inflation rate the unions central bank is utilitarian and lacks commitment countries borrow or save in a market for nominal sovereign debt in response to idiosyncratic income shocks with countries that receive positive income shocks saving and countries that receive negative income shocks borrowing ex post the monetary unions central bank will attempt to devalue sovereign debt through surprise inflation as this will redistribute income from rich creditor countries to poor debtor countries creditor countries choose to bailout debtor countries because bailouts will weaken the redistributive motives of the central bank and forestall surprise inflation as bailouts in this environment constitute a payment from lucky creditor countries to unlucky debtor countries they mimic a risksharing arrangement that insures against income shocks the payments made by creditor countries are incentivecompatible due to the shared currency and inflation rate in the monetary union this ability of countries to provide each other with incentivecompatible insurance constitutes a novel theory of optimal currency areas this insurance benefit of the monetary union is largest for countries with negatively correlated income shocks in contrast to the classic mundellfriedman optimal currency area criterion international atlantic economic society

the essence of monetary hegemony is the power of one monetary authority to influence monetary conditions outside its jurisdiction such power did not exist under the gold standard but came into existence for the us federal reserve in the aftermath of the first world war the basis of that power was the massive drain of gold out of europe into the us during its period of neutrality and the scope for the newly created federal reserve to pursue a discretionary monetary policy with specific aims such as stable prices rapid recovery from recession and countering pullbacks in the equity market throughout its year exercise of monetary hegemony the us has used this in ways that have spread inflation around the globe both goods inflation and asset inflation both the us and the rest of the world would have benefited from a us monetary hegemon based on sound money principle rather than on inflationary finance international atlantic economic society
this study examines the relationship between firmlevel tax evasion and corruption the literature has considered the corruptionfirm tax evasion nexus to some extent however the heterogeneous impact of bribes on tax evasion has been largely ignored we posit that the impact of bribes on tax evasion is conditional on the prevalence of tax evasion using firmlevel information from the business environment and enterprise performance survey beeps across transition economies for the years and we estimate the heterogeneous impact of bribes on tax evasion using the censored quantile instrumental variables technique the results show that corruption has a larger impact when tax evasion is more widespread among other results firmlevel characteristics also show heterogeneous effects across the conditional distribution of tax evasion in terms of the policy implications the results suggest that policies that focus on reducing the tax burden and controlling corruption will be more effective when tax evasion is more prevalent international atlantic economic society

how does individual tax compliance respond to a change in the audit rate most all empirical evidence suggests that an increase in the audit rate increases the compliance rate a result that is also consistent with standard theoretical analysis of the individual compliance decision however this empirical evidence is typically based on estimating an average response across all taxpayers and an average response may conceal much heterogeneity in individual responses this paper collects individuallevel data from identical laboratory experiments across five separate studies with a total of student subjects that generated individual observations in which only audit rates are varied in order to disentangle individual responses to audit rate changes as with most previous empirical work the results indicate that the average response across all taxpayers is to increase decrease compliance when audit rates increase decrease however this average response conceals enormous heterogeneity in individual responses when the individual responses are examined in more detail the data show that many individuals do in fact respond to higher lower audit rates by increasing decreasing their compliance however these individuals represent only about twothirds of all subjects in fact many individuals do not respond at all to audit rate changes surprisingly some individuals actually decrease their compliance when audit rates increase and vice versa all of these different individual responses indicate that government policy interventions must consider the range of individual behaviors when devising appropriate policies international atlantic economic society
this paper examines the impact of unemployment and inflation on family income shares unemployment and inflation are decomposed into their structural longterm cyclical shortterm anticipated and unanticipated components respectively i propose a new framework to analyze family income quintile shares by using a twostate markovswitching model also known as hamiltons regimeswitching model the benefit of using a markovswitching model is that it permits capturing complex dynamic behavior of nonlinear time series macroeconomic variables the switching mechanism follows a firstorder markov chain of unobservable state variables and subsequent estimated conditional transition probabilities this paper applies a twostate regimeswitching process to capture the asymmetrical effects of unemployment and inflation on family income shares the two states of family income quintile shares are state lower income and state upper income this approach differs from previous studies because it examines income inequality within each quintile rather than between quintiles it is well documented in the literature that there is income inequality between lower and higher income quintiles therefore the analysis of income inequality within the quintile allows for greater insight into changes in family income share corresponding to changes in the state variables the general findings are that unemployment has adverse effects on lower income shares while inflation acts like a progressive tax on higher income shares international atlantic economic society
during the first ten seasons of integrated major league baseball black batters were hit by pitches about more often per plateappearance than white batters however on average black players during this period were superior players to investigate to what extent the difference in hitbypitch can be explained by performance and characteristics other than race we use a fractional logit model to estimate hitbypitch per plate appearance during a season our data are from baseballreferencecom controlling for differences in performance and other characteristics and including interaction terms with race the difference falls to about a little over half the difference is explained by factors beyond race the remaining difference might reflect different batting styles for early black batters however when observations where hitbypitch per plate appearance are in the top of the sample are removed black players were about more likely to be hit plots of the marginal effects from a model using interactive terms show that the likelihood of a black player being hit rose relative to that of a white player as baseonballs singles doubles home runs or stolen bases per plate appearance rose some pitchers may have exhibited animosity towards black players either by hitting them or taking less care to avoid hitting them our findings support previous research that better batters and batters who play for teams who score more runs are more likely to be hit by pitches because empirical evidence suggests pitchers might alter pitches to intimidate discriminate or retaliate changes to existing rules could reduce the frequency of hitsbypitch international atlantic economic society
we evaluate the effect of performancebased scholarship programs for postsecondary students on student time use and effort and whether these effects are different for students we hypothesize may be more or less responsive to incentives to do so we administered a timeuse survey as part of a randomized experiment in which community college students in new york city were randomly assigned to be eligible for a performancebased scholarship or to a control group that was only eligible for the standard financial aid this paper contributes to the literature by attempting to get inside the black box of how students respond to a monetary incentive to improve their educational attainment we find that students eligible for a scholarship devoted more time to educational activities increased the quality of effort toward and engagement with their studies and allocated less time to leisure additional analyses suggest that students who were plausibly more myopic place less weight on future benefits were more responsive to the incentives but we find no evidence that students who are arguably more time constrained were less responsive to the incentives international atlantic economic society
the objective of this paper is to examine the foundations of modern monetary theory mmt by building upon the individual papers in this issue of the atlantic economic journal by mark skousen and patrick newman the foundations of mmt include five cornerstones first sovereign governments that are the sole supplier of a national currency eg united states can issue as much currency as they want have unlimited ability to fulfill promised future payments and cannot go bankrupt second legislation enables spending while taxes neither place a limit nor specify government spending earmarked taxes would be an exception third a sovereign government can borrow as much as it likes in pursuit of laudable public sector projects or fiscal policy programs to manage the economic cycle fourth a huge and growing national debt is beneficial to the economy as long as inflation remains contained a fifth feature the blogosphere shaped the emergence of mmt largely in the absence of technical vetting and critical empirical examination the popularization derived for mmt through the blogosphere will have a profound effect on us politics and economic policy in the s and s the foundations of mmt are refuted by the work of public finance theorists david ricardo james buchanan robert barro and alberto alesina international atlantic economic society
modern monetary theory mmt argues that governments can never go bankrupt because they have the power to print money to finance budget deficits consequently debt monetization can achieve virtually any government objective desired this paper uses austrian economics to argue that mmt suffers from the flaws of all forms of keynesian economics particularly the original version of the s and s mmt fails to understand capitalbased macroeconomics and how government policy affects the temporal structure of production mmt also neglects the importance of profit and loss accounting compared to government allocation of resources the austrian school argues that traditional new keynesian countercyclical monetary policy results in a creditinduced boom and bust austrian business cycle theory by injecting new money into private sector loans through the banking sector however austrian analysis demonstrates that mmts monetary policy to monetize government deficits and increase the money supply through government spending will instead lead to secular economic stagnation and a stunted capital structure overall the policy prescriptions of mmt are far more dangerous than traditional new keynesian policies international atlantic economic society
this paper considers the persistence of earnings differentials between wage earners and the selfemployed through modeling overconfidence the model examines challenges of limited information and its impact in the decisionmaking process using a bayesian setting and concentrating specifically on the entrepreneurs entry decision the model shows how limited information can lead to substantial overestimation of potential profits and other outcomes even if the decisionmaker has unbiased prior beliefs the driving force behind the conclusion is the assumption that decisionmakers such as entrepreneurs are not aware that available information is limited for entrepreneurship the resulting bias leads to overconfidence excessive entry and the persistence of lower returns to entrepreneurship when compared to returns in the wage sector this situation may arise wherever attrition is present from military to business schools to medicine going the extra mile to gather and incorporate all relevant information into decisionmaking pays off in better quality decisions international atlantic economic society

this paper provides new evidence supporting the hypothesis that patriotism and nationalism influence personal trade policy preferences in addition to the typical economic determinants it also examines the interaction of the terrorist attacks along with patriotism and nationalism on policy preferences using the heckscherohlin model as a theoretical framework ordered probit estimations were applied to survey responses from an international social survey program survey question about preferences towards limiting imports extensions of the model were sequentially estimated to investigate the impact of national identity on policy preferences the model was augmented to test how feelings of nationalism and patriotism influenced personal trade policy preferences data from the international social survey program surveys administered in and also allowed us to reflect on the impact of the terrorist attacks on trade preferences in the us we found that prior to the attacks nationalism was associated with increased inclinations towards limiting imports while patriotism had no statistically significant impact on trade preferences the attacks made us survey respondents less open to imports further the attacks served to reduce the impact of nationalism on the tendency to limit imports while it enhanced the desire to do so through patriotism international atlantic economic society
public policy aimed at reducing consumption of tobacco or alcohol products often results in purchases of lowertaxed alternatives many studies find tobacco and alcohol to be habitforming so taxing these commodities often has little impact in reducing purchases there is much evidence that different alcohol and tobacco products are either substitutes or complements in use but these studies exclude the impact of casino gambling and lotteries this is surprising given the evidence of high returns for companies investing in all types of sin goods the demand for sin goods is analyzed using both myopic and rational habitforming models durability was found to be largest for wine and tobacco and lowest for casino gambling tobacco and beer were the most net habitforming commodities all sin goods were net habitforming in the rational model but under myopic habit formation spirits and wine were net durable goods the research highlights the importance of including casino gambling and lotteries which are typically excluded when estimating substitution or complementarity between sin goods casino gambling and lotteries are both net habitforming and are substitutes in use for each other imposing taxes to reduce the misuse of alcohol and tobacco products is likely to have some unintended consequences such as increases in personal expenditure on casino gambling and lotteries international atlantic economic society

this paper uses a threetax linear model to study the optimal tax mix numerically the three aggregate taxes relate to labour capital and commodities the most striking result is that with a linear expenditure system based on econometric estimates indirect ie commodity taxation dominates the optimal tax mix with over of tax revenue coming from indirect taxes the main reason for this outcome appears to be that commodity taxation has a less harmful effect on labour supply than labour income taxation and a less harmful effect on capital supply than capital income taxation comprehensive computational modelling of the optimal tax mix has been absent from the literature in light of the results presented here there appears to be considerable scope for further research in this area from a theoretical perspective a major innovation in this paper is the introduction of capital taxation into a static tax mix model the analytical part of the paper provides approximate predictions for optimal linear tax rates called the modified inverse elasticity rule using these formulas explanations are provided for the dominance of indirect taxation in the optimal tax mix international atlantic economic society
when participating in an auction is costly a potential bidder has to decide whether to enter the auction or not the extent to which the potential bidders know their private cost before making their entry decisions determines how selective the entry process is endogenous selective entry is common in many auctions and it has important implications for designing auctions in particular choosing the bid discount policy that is frequently used in public procurements to achieve distributional goals of the government prior empirical studies of the bid preferences were based on frameworks that either did not explicitly model endogenous participation or assumed endogenous but nonselective participation this study empirically investigated whether the entry process is selective in the highway procurement auctions run by the california department of transportation to this end the asymmetric affiliatedsignal model was adapted to permit endogenous selective entry model parameters including entry costs and distributions of construction costs for regular and fringe companies were estimated nonparametrically the results show evidence favoring selective entry of the fringe firms and imply that the level of bid discount required to achieve the procurement buyers policy objective may be lower than what is previously found in the literature under the assumption of nonselective entry international atlantic economic society

recent demographic and economic research has analyzed the expected increase in the proportion of the population who are elderly one consequence of an increasing elderly population is expansion in health care utilization hence funding problems may arise european institutions encourage member states to promote good health among their citizens to mitigate the ageing effects on the health care system our objective was to examine the effect of healthy lifestyles among southern european older adults on health care utilization by focusing on the number of outpatient doctor visits odv and nights hospitalized nh negative binominal regressions were conducted using a panel data set consisting of five waves of the survey of health ageing and retirement in europe share our results add new empirical evidence on the effect of southern european older adults lifestyles on their health care utilization engaging in vigorous physical activities reduces the number of odv visits and nh by and respectively moreover smoking increases nh by member states should establish policies to promote healthy lifestyles with vigorous physical activities playing a key role to reduce health services utilization international atlantic economic society
using hourly and weekly wages from the canadian labour force survey from until workers were separated into fulltime and parttime and the following striking observation was documented the overall gender wage gap is larger than either the fulltime pay gap or the parttime pay gap even after controlling for detailed personal and job characteristics this result is a consequence of two findings i parttime wages are lower than fulltime wages and ii the majority of parttime workers are women in aggregation this brings down the average female wage leading to a larger aggregate gender wage gap this was further linked to a differential selection by gender into fulltime and parttime work with women of higher earnings potential being overrepresented in the pool of parttime workers resulting in no gender pay gap in the parttime worker category policies targeted at encouraging fulltime employment for women should therefore reduce the gender wage gap international atlantic economic society
standard models of indirect price discrimination generate a separating equilibrium in which all consumers choose bundles on their demand curves lowdemand consumers voluntarily choose to pay a higher unit price for small quantities because the discount is offered by the monopolist at prohibitively high quantity these models implicitly assume the lowdemand consumer would purchase the higher quantity at the discounted price if the quantity requirement were set at a low quantity but rational monopoly pricing avoids this we show that it is possible for a monopolist to offer pricequantity bundles that induce each consumer to choose voluntarily the one preferred by the monopolist for her where each bundle is above the respective consumers demand curve the primary theoretical results include greater profits for the firm and greater total efficiency as output more closely approaches the socially optimal level in both market segments resolving an ambiguity from earlier research on price discrimination the model also unequivocally demonstrates that consumer surplus is reduced an important implication of the monopolist constraining consumption to be above the demand curve for her product is that she has effectively reduced the demand for some subset of other goods and services the consumers purchase international atlantic economic society
this paper analyzes the extent to which the filming of the popular television show game of thrones affected tourism in the croatian city of dubrovnik using monthly data and applying differenceindifferences the study shows that the impact of airing game of thrones episodes filmed in dubrovnik corresponded to approximately additional tourism overnights per month or approximately per year existing results were extended to show that the additional overnights mainly occur during the tourism offseason when transportation and lodging prices are ostensibly lower consistent with anecdotal evidence the results provide another example that the filming of a television show can increase the attractiveness of an already wellestablished and globallyknown destination the results are especially useful for tourism industries in countries with highly seasonal tourism activities like croatia that usually depend on beneficial climatic conditions which are highly unpredictable and volatile filming of popular television shows and increased tourism may provide additional revenue for local economies and help smooth seasonal and yearly volatility of local income international atlantic economic society

increased transportation costs and tense competition necessitate that carriers coordinate with the other members of the supply chain for realizing potential savings due to channel coordination we address such coordination issues in an operational setting where a carrier is to ship the items within a twoechelon supply channel consisting of a supplier eg manufacturer and a buyer eg retailer operating under the assumptions of the traditional economic order quantity eoq problem setting we consider the case where the supplierbuyer pair is operated in a centralized fashion potentially under a vendormanaged inventory vmi agreement and hence referred to as the supplierbuyer partnership whereas the carrier is a separate entity we examine the optimal solutions of the parties under various freight schedules ie transportation pricing mechanisms including freight discounts fixed charges for each shipment and fixed charges for each truck used in the delivery our goal is to identify alternative transportation pricing contracts serving the carrier and supplierbuyer partnership from the carriers perspective and coordinating the supply chain system at hand we find that freight discounts and per shipment fixed charges may not offer an effective contractual mechanism and sometimes it is better for the carrier to offer negative discounts or fixed rewards per shipment we also show that asking for a fixed charge per truck would always motivate the supplierbuyer partnership to operate at the centralized solution if the carrier sets the fixed charge per truck equal the fixed cost per truck reflecting its own operating costs in the asking price and achieving positive profits through the additional per unit freight rate in an extensive numerical study we benchmark the cost efficiency of centralized versus decentralized channels and illustrate that the benefits of the three transportation pricing mechanisms considered in this paper elsevier bv
due to rapid advances in technology and design firms periodically release new generations of electronic products such as mobile phones and computers in order to increase product variability firms may wish to develop a multiplegeneration product line rather than replace the older versions with new ones however when multiple generations are available in the market different generations compete with each other as well as other products in the market firms need to take joint decisions for the purpose of inventory management and dynamic pricing of multiple generations to tackle impact of uncertain demand and market competition in this paper we present a dynamic joint productionpricing decision model to obtain optimal strategies for a firm selling multiple generations of a product we account for the internal competition among multiple generations by evaluating customer choices in order to tackle a curse of dimensionality we introduce a forward dynamic programming approach for approximately solving the joint productionpricing problem we also propose a twostage heuristic algorithm as an alternative solution approach different pricing rules determined from the abridged model and a price list derived by theoretical bounds are integrated to improve further computational performance of the solution approaches we design computational experiments to illustrate effectiveness and efficiency of these approximate methods and show the benefit of joint decisionmaking process in multigeneration product line

omnichannel retailing is a popular strategy in a new retailing era when digitalization social media big data and other emerging technologies eg artificial intelligence ai virtual reality vr augmented reality ar blockchain etc are transforming the retail business models meanwhile omnichannel related operations impose a challenge on either wellestablished firms or new setups that they have to make right decisions to fit in the new retail environment this review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omnichannel retailing literature generate managerial implications for firms and provides a guideline for future research we conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis cna the cna helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains which depict or constitute a whole picture of omnichannel management the main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study we also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the omnichannel management moreover the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review therefore we propose a prescribed framework for omnichannel management pfom which contributes to the literature on omnichannel management and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy
with increasing supply chain complexity companies strive to enhance the visibility in their supply chains but with a spanning network across national borders it is essential to consider dissimilar cultural behavior thus this paper aims to analyze the role of dissimilar nationalcultural behaviors on supply chain visibility scv and to evaluate how companies can adapt to these behavioral characteristics to increase scv internationally the methodology of the paper is twofold first the paper engages in a systematic literature review slr evaluating behavioral characteristics for scv enhancement because of a multiinterpretable nature of existing literature the study then follows a qualitative approach including transcribed semistructured interviews with supply chain experts from companies in germany japan and the usa the findings indicate that scvenhancing behaviors differ based on cultural characteristics however the single consideration of these characteristics possesses an interpretable nature resulting in a paradoxical situation by this the findings indicate that similar cultural dimensional characteristics can be dissimilar based on the influence of other dimensional factors overall this study provides an indication of the importance of national culture for scv and the relevance of cultural adaption to enhancing scv through this it opens the door for further research in this field the three countries selected can be used as a proxy to measure similar cultures based on hofstedes cultural dimension model and thus the contribution strives for analytical generalizability beyond the three countries elsevier bv
we study the optimal pricing and return policy and the value of freight insurance for a retailer selling a product to heterogeneous consumers with uncertain values of the product for the case with no return freight cost we find that the optimal sale price and refund depend on the heterogeneity of consumers and the proportion of highvalue consumers when consumer heterogeneity is relatively high and the proportion of highvalue consumers is very high the retailer should not adopt the return policy otherwise the retailer should adopt it for the case with a positive return freight cost the retailer has to set a higher refund or a lower price hurting its profit when consumer heterogeneity is relatively high and the proportion of highvalue consumers is very high the optimal price is unchanged but the optimal refund increases in other situations the retailer needs to reduce the price or increase the refund to attract consumers further considering the case where the retailer provides return freight insurance for the consumers we find that whether freight insurance benefits the retailer depends on the unit insurance premium and the return freight cost elsevier bv
this paper considers a twoechelon pharmaceutical supply chain comprising two pharmaceutical manufacturers and a pharmacy we derive optimal decisions for three different supply chain power structures considering two scenarios one scenario featuring quality regulation and one without by comparing the equilibriums of the two regulatory scenarios under different power structures we then evaluate the effects of quality regulation and power structure on pharmaceutical firms decisions profits and social welfare our results show that the product differentiation between two pharmaceutical manufacturers will be reduced through quality regulation serving to intensify price competition between them this has a negative impact on the two pharmaceutical manufacturers but a positive effect on the pharmacys profit however an appropriate level of minimum quality standards can enhance social welfare and the economic performance of the whole pharmaceutical supply chain resulting in a winwin outcome in addition our results demonstrate that the balanced power structure has a positive effect on the pharmaceutical supply chains economic performance and social welfare elsevier bv
supply chain gap analysis is a practical method for quantitatively measuring the gap between the current state and a desiredideal state in a supply chain and generating a list of corrective actions to eliminate this gap and reach a desiredideal level in supply chain goals we propose a novel multiobjective coevolutionary approach for supply chain gap analysis by hybridizing two wellknown algorithms of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii and multiple objective particle swarm optimization mopso the proposed algorithm considers the best solution of nsgaii at each iteration and uses it as the initial population in mopso we consider three objective functions including the expected costs the total time and customer satisfaction the house of quality and quality function deployment is used to transform customer requirements into product characteristics we also use a response surface methodology with multiobjective decision making for tuning the parameters since metaheuristic methods are generally sensitive to input parameters we finally generate several random problems with different scenarios to compare the performance of our hybrid approach with singular methods five performance measures ie mean ideal distance diversification metric quality metric data envelopment analysis and hypervolume metric are used for this comparison the results show the hybrid approach proposed in this study outperforms singular nsgaii and mopso metaheuristics in most scenarios elsevier bv

in this paper we search for the best configuration for a closedloop supply chain clsc dealing with complementary goods in our model a manufacturer sells two complementary goods to a retailer which sells both products in the market when the products reach their endofuse stage the manufacturer has several options for the clsc i collect both products exclusive collection ii collect only one product while outsourcing the other product collection to the retailer partial outsourcing and iii fully outsource the collection process to the retailer full outsourcing our findings demonstrate that the presence of complementary products makes the clsc selection extremely difficult for instance we demonstrate that the clsc structure with maximum returns does not necessarily possess the minimum or the maximum wholesale price analogously the minimum retail price ie maximum sales and maximum return rate often occur in different collection options we also show that the best collection option for the manufacturer seldom leads to the maximum profit for the retailer moreover often the clsc option that maximizes the manufacturers profit leads to lower returns therefore the presence of complementary products entails several tradeoffs among collection performance prices and profits elsevier bv

reliable demand forecasts are critical for effective supply chain management several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the dynamics of demand and hence a single statistical model that only consists of historical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts in practice the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information that are not incorporated in the baseline models there are however systematic events whose effect can be quantified and modeled to help minimize human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts in this paper we develop and test a novel regimeswitching approach to quantify systematic informationevents and objectively incorporate them into the baseline statistical model our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities the model is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two australian companies the model is also benchmarked against commonly employed statistical and machine learning forecasting models discussions focus on thorough analysis of promotions impact and benchmarking results we show that the proposed model can successfully improve forecast accuracy and avoid poor forecasts when compared to the current industry practice which heavily relies on human judgment to factor in all types of informationevents the proposed model also outperforms sophisticated machine learning methods by mitigating the generation of extremely poor forecasts that drastically differ from actual sales due to changes in demand states elsevier bv
despite a growing research interest in innovation strategies ie new product development very few studies explore how the regional environmental mechanism is inherent in the link between new product development and sustainable business performance of small and medium manufacturing enterprises smmes in asian countries due to highvelocity business environments to address this research gap the study integrates the dynamic capability perspective and the institutional and entrepreneurship theory in the investigation of how the distinct regional characteristics of the intranational market in which smmes are embedded along with the dynamic capability of smmes influence the linkage between new product development and sustainable firm performance using china as the research setting we test the research model empirically based on samples of smmes selected from a nationwide survey the new findings indicate that an smmes regional institutional forces regional entrepreneurial intensity and dynamic capability moderate the effects of new product development on firms sustainable performance by mitigating the inherent inadequacy of and reliance on firmspecific resources by smmes the new findings also provide the research and managerial implications for smmes from asian economies conducting new product development strategies
physicians active engagement is a critical part of sustaining online health communities ohcs development gamification design can be leveraged to invoke physicians gameful experience better motivating their engagement in ohcs however it can also create inequality of economic returns among physicians causing harm to these communities drawing on this operational paradox this paper empirically examines both positive and negative effects of gamification on physicians and the contingent role of disparity in professional seniority on their engagement and inequality of economic returns to advance knowledge of such practices although gamification design engages physicians and increases their income the results indicate increased economic inequality among the physicians as a consequence considering physicians higher professional seniority in the same department it weakens the positive effect of gamification design on their engagements but strengthens such effect on economic inequality managers are advised to carefully plan their gamification design in order to promote physician engagement in ohcs and avoid the related paradoxes
current trends related to increased sustainability requirements the application of new digital technologies and changes in consumer behavior have disrupted conventional food supply chains entailing challenges for the last mile logistics and distribution of food products the main aim of this study is to develop a toolset for exploring the sustainability potential of last mile logistics and distribution strategies employing a centralized distribution network with a click collect option a decentralized distribution network with a homedelivery option and a distributed network based on a crowd logistics concept for this a system dynamics sd simulation and a multicriteria decision aid mcda were applied to assess the sustainability performance of these distribution channel options for a case study of a local food cooperative and a logistics service provider in austria the sustainability potential of developing a new logistics system in collaboration with these players has been estimated for the first time while considering the dynamic interplay of all relevant sustainability elements within operational tactical and strategic planning the results show that an integration of the two players into a distributed network strategy based on a crowd logistics concept is the most viable and sustainable option this highlights the significant role of the logistics sector in proactively innovating services to make sustainable choices easier for the customer
timevarying behavioral features and nonlinear dependence are widely observed in big data and challenge the operating systems and processes of risk management in financial services in order to improve the operational accuracy of risk measures and incorporate customer behavior analytics we propose a bayesian approach to efficiently estimate the multivariate risk measures in a dynamic framework the proposed method can carry the prior information into the bayesian analysis and fully describe the risk measures behavior after utilizing the cornishfisher cf approximation with markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling therefore the operating systems and processes of risk management can be well performed either based on the first four conditional moments of the underlying model employed to consider some specific behavioral features eg the timevarying conditional multivariate skewness or the characteristics extracted from the big data we conduct a simulation study to distinguish the applications of cf approximation and mcmc sampling after comparing them with the classic likelihood based method we then provide a robust procedure for empirical investigation by using the real data of us djia stocks both simulation and empirical results confirm that the bayesian method can significantly improve the operations of risk management

in this study we consider two firms in a supply chain namely an upstream firm and a downstream firm the downstream firm sources products from the upstream firm for the further production and makes sales to the final consumers and each firm strives to reduce carbon emissions we find that one firms support on another firm to reduce carbon emissions always benefits all players in the supply chain in terms of firm profit consumer utility and carbon emissions reduction compared with the no supporting case in addition we show that the upstream firms support on the downstream firm creates more benefit than the downstream firms support on the upstream firm while higher carbon emissions reduction effort is not a panacea for the environment the support from the upstream firm tends to be more effective in reducing total carbon emissions elsevier bv
as a widely used inventory management technique multiple criteria abc analysis is an effective way to classify inventory items into prioritized classes various methods have been proposed to solve the problem of multiple criteria abc analysis however the information provided by experts or experienced managers is typically taken without any doubt in existing research little attention has been paid to the accuracy of the furnished sample classifications to close the gap this paper proposes a model to accommodate the possibility of misclassifications in the given information the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the parameters in the model to avoid local optimum grid search is implemented when the initial estimation is set odds are used to identify potential misclassifications in the given sample data the proposed method is validated with both simulated and reallife data sets the results show that the proposed method has a better performance in terms of classification accuracy and can learn the classification rules of experts from the training set and apply them to classify new items elsevier bv
this research develops the notion of operational resilience and investigates its relationship with operational efficiency under differing conditions of operational disruption operational resilience is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of two theoretically distinct components ie disruption absorption and recoverability which are argued to have unique effects on operational efficiency under varying operational disruption conditions the studys hypotheses are empirically tested on primary data from a sample of firms in a subsaharan african economy using structural equation modeling as an analytical tool the study finds that both disruption absorption and recoverability have positive effects on operational efficiency additionally the study finds that while the effect of disruption absorption on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of high operational disruption the effect of recoverability on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of low operational disruption a major implication of these findings is that the nature of operational resilience and the disruption circumstances under which it is deployed shape its efficiency value thus advancing knowledge on the nuances associated with how and when operational resilience influences operational efficiency elsevier bv

in project appraisal under uncertainty the economic reliability of a measure of financial efficiency such as a rate of return depends on its strong npvconsistency meaning that the performance metric i supplies the same recommendation in acceptreject decisions as the npv ii ranks competing projects in the same way as the npv iii has the same sensitivity to perturbations in the input data as the npv in reallife projects financial efficiency is greatly affected by the management of the working capital using a sensitivity analysis approach and taking into explicit account the role of working capital we show that the average return on investment roi is not strongly npvconsistent in acceptreject decisions if the working capital is uncertain and changes under changes in revenues and costs also it is not strongly npvconsistent in project ranking we also show that the internal rate of return irr is not strongly npvconsistent and economic analysis may even turn out to be impossible owing to possible nonexistence and multiplicity caused by perturbations in the input data as well as to possible shifts in the financial meaning of irr under changes in the projects value drivers we introduce the straightline rate of return slrr based on the notion of average rate of change which overcomes all the problems encountered by average roi and irr it always exists is unique strongly npvconsistent for both acceptreject decisions and project ranking and has an unambiguous financial nature elsevier bv
we developed a model that integrates the schedule of a sequence of resumable jobs and inspection policy for the processing of n jobs with different processing times in a singlecomponent system whose failures follow a twostage process the assignment of inspections is performed at the beginning of the job if an inspection detects the system to be in a defective state preventive replacement is performed whereas if the system fails minimal repair is carried out to restore the system to an operational condition in the defective state analytical and simulation models are proposed to establish the best sequence of jobs and inspections that minimize the expected total cost the expected total cost is composed of expected maintenance cost and expected tardiness cost we present a numerical study that demonstrates the importance of integrating inspection policy with the sequencing of jobs as such integration can lead to a significant cost reduction the most interesting insights brought by the model highlight the importance of the effectiveness of maintenance actions perform actions in smaller time and less cost as well as the importance of deciding the correct moment to do them considering the sequence of jobs elsevier bv

managing customer returns is a crucial issue for the retailing industry in this paper we develop a model to investigate a monopolistic retailers customer returns management strategy the retailer should determine its returns policy a moneyback guarantee mbg or norefund if an mbg returns policy is offered the retailer must also decide whether or not to sell the returned products as openbox products we derive the optimal pricing strategy for each of the returns strategies and identify the retailers optimal customer returns management strategy we show when the retailer should implement each of the returns policies and when it should sell the returned products as openbox products we also show that even when the retailer cannot handle customer returns efficiently it could choose to offer an mbg returns policy and sell returned products as openbox products if the cost of inspecting returned items is low finally we show that the retailer can simplify the choice of returns management strategy based on identifiable quantities and threshold values the implications of this study are also discussed elsevier bv
this paper provides a risk assessment framework to select shipping lanes for pharmaceutical products the main categories of risks are determined through an algorithm based on yesno decisions then according to the risk categories a failure mode and effects analysis fmea table is proposed for risk assessment of pharmaceutical product shipments and logistics the evaluations are based on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns to be able to account for the uncertainty in the experts judgments by using an intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution approach the evaluated risks of each shipment lane can be scored and prioritized the proposed topsisbased fmea approach in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment provides an opportunity to aggregate the risk assessments of different experts in a practically efficient way different from the earlier literature we address risk identification and risk assessment under uncertainty as the two key challenges in group decision making our method further provides a framework that integrates the categorization and evaluation of risks with subsequent decision making a case study of shipping lane selection in the context of air cargo distribution of pharmaceutical products demonstrates a potential implementation of the proposed approach
in this paper we investigate the contract design in a multiresource service supply chain between a first line service provider and an emergency supplier under information asymmetry the service provider is contractually responsible for the timely repair of the assets that fail under a given service level agreement with the asset owner to execute a repair the service provider needs both engineers and spare parts to replace malfunctioning parts in case of a spare parts stock out the service provider can either wait for the regular replenishment of parts from the central depot or decide to hand over the entire call to an emergency supplier for the latter case a contract between the service provider and the supplier is necessary that specifies how the emergency supplier is compensated by the service provider particularly we investigate what is the best contract the supplier can offer when information on asset reliability only resides with the service provider but remains hidden for the emergency supplier information asymmetry in the first type of contracts the supplier charges the service provider a price specified in a socalled priceonly contract for each time he takes over a call as an alternative we study the socalled revenuesharing contracts in which the supplier receives a fraction of the service providers annual revenue and in return agrees to charge a lower price per call in addition to the standard single revenuesharing contract we study the implementation of a menu of revenuesharing contracts we show that finding a menu of revenuesharing contracts is not always possible and if possible does not necessarily give a higher profit to the supplier than a single revenuesharing contract in an extensive numerical experiment we show that the combination of the single and the menu of revenuesharing contracts results in on average less than loss of the supplier profit under perfect symmetric information additionally we find that while having private information on the assets failure rates increases the service provider profit the increase is insignificant resulting in an additional profit of only on average finally we observe that the supplier can increase his profit on average up to if he incites the lsp by means of a sidepayment mechanism to share his private information elsevier bv

raw material down conversion is common in practice in which highend raw materials may be transformed into lowend materials to make lowend products at a downconversion cost motivated by this phenomenon this paper investigates the profitmaximizing manufacturers joint input quantity downconversion policy and pricing decisions in a coproduction system wherein two vertical differentiated products are simultaneous manufactured we employ two stylized modeling approaches ie deterministic yield model and random yield model to formulate the manufacturers operation behavior we find that the adoption of downconversion policy is threshold controlled by the unit downconversion cost in each yield scenario and only when the unit downconversion cost is sufficiently low will the manufacturer adopt this policy in detail the implementation of this policy tends to exaggerate the total demand base demand enhancement effect and increase the price differentiation relieved cannibalization effect to benefit from this policy sufficiently the manufacturer is always aggressive to input more quantity regardless of the yield pattern ie deterministic or random specifically when the manufacturer adopts downconversion policy under the assumption that the random yield follows a uniform distribution the optimal input quantity in the random yield scenario is higher than that in the deterministic yield scenario when the unit downconversion cost is low and vice versa in addition the manufacturer has higher possibility to implement downconversion policy in the random yield scenario elsevier bv

servitization has been viewed as an important method for manufacturers to gain competitive advantages the purpose of the study is to empirically examine the effects of lean and agile practices as well as mass customization and product innovation capabilities on the implementation of servitization the hypotheses are empirically examined using structural equation modeling with data collected from manufacturers the results show that product innovation capability directly improves servitization although the direct effect of mass customization capability on servitization is not significant it improves servitization indirectly through product innovation capability the findings also reveal that the direct impacts of lean and agile practices on servitization are not significant lean and agile practices affect servitization indirectly through product innovation capability whereas the indirect effects of lean and agile practices on servitization through mass customization capability are not significant therefore this study draws the conclusions that a manufacturer should develop mass customization and product innovation capabilities simultaneously when implementing servitization moreover a manufacturer should also invest on lean and agile practices and product innovation capability at the same time when transforming to a servicebased business model to cultivate their synergies on servitization elsevier bv
we study a problem where given a railway network and different fleets we have to locate maintenance locations and allocate the fleets to these locations the allocation of fleets to the maintenance locations complicates the maintenance location routing problem for each candidate location different facility sizes can be chosen and for each size there is an associated annual facility cost that captures the economies of scale in facility size because of the strategic nature of facility location these facilities should be able to handle changes such as adjustments to the line plan and the introduction of new rolling stock types we capture these changes by discrete scenarios and we formulate this twostage stochastic problem as a mixed integer problem furthermore we perform a case study with the netherlands railways that provides novel managerial insights by showing that the number of opened maintenance facilities highly depends on the allocation restrictions
this paper argues both small and large firms use different resource allocation patterns to benefit from implementing environmental management practices emps and environmental management systems ems results from the multigroup structural equation analyses of a survey of manufacturing firms in two countries support the resource allocation arguments large firms use resourcedemanding emps such as green product design and green production to improve outcomes in environmental costreduction and business performance while small firms choose resourcelight emps such as green logistics and green packaging to gain only environmental and costreduction benefits the paper advances the existing resourceadvantage view by revealing different resource allocation patterns and provides meaningful recommendations through which policy makers can address various resource allocation constraints among small and large enterprises elsevier bv
manufacturing planning and control systems ideally seek to simultaneously achieve short and predictable flow times as well as high output and duedate performance one approach to address this problem is the workload control concept it is based on the idea to control lead times by controlling order releases and thus the level of workinprocess and output the focus of this paper is on multiperiod optimization models for order release planning we use a simulation study of a make to order manufacturer in a rolling horizon setting and compare the performance of an order release model that assumes fixed lead times and a model that allows for variable lead times an input output control and a clearing function model respectively we analyze two different approaches to cope with the varying and tight due date slack and find that including more foreknowledge of demand is preferable finally we show that the clearing function model outperforms the input output control model in all scenarios by yielding lower inventory levels with shorter shop floor throughput times this advantage seems not to be affected by the predictability of the demand but the ioc model narrows the gap when using near optimal parameters especially for a scenario with deterministic demand

recent advances in the industrial internet of things and smart data analytics have empowered companies to shift towards an open manufacturing paradigm to crowdsource and share manufacturing resources based on demand and capacities across the value chain reconfigurable process planning rpp reconstructs the optimal process planning for each batch according to different part batches based on commonality in combination with the optimal crowdsourcing contracting occ strategy rpp helps release fixed capital and increase the flexibility of the enterprise under the requirement of diversified parts the coupling of process planning and crowdsourcing contracting decisions is inherent in open manufacturing this paper focuses on coordinated optimization underlying occ with rpp an occ decisionmaking mechanism considering rpp based on stackelberg game theory is established which provides a solution for tradeoffs between the rpp decisionmaker and the occ decisionmaker a coordinated optimization model is proposed to reveal the hierarchical relationships and is solved by a nesting genetic algorithm a case study of a group of rotating shaft parts is taken to illustrate the effectiveness of the bilevel coordinated optimization bco model the results present that the commonality has an apparent impact on the occ and rpp decisions in open manufacturing and integrating it into process planning activities is advisable for platform enterprises to increase production efficiency and competitive advantages our proposed model can deal with the conflict and coordination between occ and rpp and balances the benefits of platform enterprise with the optimal contractor impacts triggered by planning activities elsevier bv
this paper studies the spatialtemporal hedging coordination problem in the prefabricated housing production the heavy double handling cost is the major reason that causes profit loss of project manager the spatialtemporal method is capable of mitigating this double handling cost by reducing assembly time uncertainty and onsite congestion probability substantially however adopting hedging methods adds extra cost and pressure to the adopters to encourage the building contractor who makes the temporal hedging decision to choose a larger assembly time hedging ath amount a hedging effortsharing hes mechanism is proposed in this research we built an analytical model to investigate how hes mechanism affects spatialtemporal hedging decisions the performance of the building contractor project manager as well as the whole supply chain three scenarios with fixed hes terms under decentralized setting are examined i nash model ii building contractor led stackelberg model and iii project manager led stackelberg model closedform results regarding the optimal spatialtemporal hedging decisions are obtained besides we derive the threshold of the hes terms under which a winwin coordination can be achieved furthermore an integrated setting with negotiable hes terms is explored we derive the optimal values of hes terms which incents the individual optimal spatialtemporal hedging decisions identical with that obtained in the centralized setting by conducting numerical studies it is found that a higher site congestion probability and a lower demand uncertainty encourage the project manager to share more ath effort while a lower unit ath cost and higher site space hedging effortsharing rate entice the building contractor to burden more ath effort surprisingly in the proposed hes mechanism the building contractors profit is increasing in site congestion probability and the project managers profit increases in the demand uncertainty elsevier bv
we analyze in a gametheoretic framework the sequential product positioning problem of two asymmetric firms with different quality levels on a platform when network effects present where the negative influences of product differentiation on product compatibility are explicitly considered we obtain closedform solutions to the positioning problem and reveal that whether the traditional wisdom of positioning in the mass market is still optimal for the leader in our setting depends not only on whether it has a quality advantage over the follower but also on the intensity of the network effects for the follower as the network effects increase or its quality advantage increases its product positioning approaches the mass product otherwise the opposite is true we also observe that the optimal degree of differentiation has certain robustness with respect to the order of the positioning decisions in addition we find that the degree of product differentiation in the sequential positioning scenario is lower than in the simultaneous positioning scenario while it is higher than in the social welfare maximization scenario this research provides concrete guidelines for hightech firms to make pertinent strategic decisions and lays a foundation for platform managers to design policies to coordinate its members elsevier bv
in this paper we consider a supply chain with one supplier and two competing retailers we make a major contribution by studying simultaneous inventory competition and transshipment between the retailers specifically we focus on the following research questions how should the retailers order before demand uncertainty is realized how should they transship between themselves after demand uncertainty is realized how can they achieve coordination in the presence of both inventory competition and transshipment to answer these questions we first derive the retailers optimal ordering quantities under both centralization and decentralization by comparing the optimal ordering quantities under centralization and decentralization we further derive the optimal transshipment price we find that if the competitive intensity represented by customer switching rate is low the decentralized retailers can achieve lateral coordination by setting an appropriate transshipment price otherwise the decentralized retailers optimal transshipment price equals the transshipment cost and they cannot achieve lateral coordination via transshipment we then propose an overstockrisk and transshipmentcost sharing contract with vendormanaged inventory and prove that it can coordinate this supply chain and provide arbitrary profit allocation to gain more managerial insights we also conduct numerical analysis to illustrate how various parameters such as the competitive intensity the transshipment cost and the products profit margin impact the inventory competition and transshipment elsevier bv

timebased competition has attracted a lot of attention since the s supply chain managers have tried various approaches to improve their performance by leadtime reduction both leadtime itself and its variance this paper explores and quantifies these benefits of such leadtime reduction for commonly used reorderpoint batchordering inventory policies rather than using approximate total cost equations we present an exact total cost equation that is built on an inherent relationship between onhand inventory and backorder thus our marginal value analysis on leadtime and its variance achieves more accurate results our analytical results show that the inventory cost is a strictly increasing concave function of both leadtime and its variance in other words the cost savings on both leadtime and its variance reduction decrease when leadtime becomes larger we also show that both cost savings increase linearly in the inventory holding cost rate our numerical examples confirm our analytical results and provide sensitivity analysis on different levels of variable demand and variable leadtime when both demand and leadtime coefficients of variation are very small the focus is on leadtime variance reduction for other cases the focus should be on leadtime reduction elsevier bv
we consider a supplierbuyer chain where the supplier sells a single product to the buyer over a singleperiod selling season but the initial inventory level at the buyers location is not observable to the supplier and should be reported to the supplier the interaction between the supplier and the buyer is modeled as a stackelberg game with asymmetric inventory information the key feature of our model framework is the nonnegative asymmetric inventory information assumption at the buyers location because of this point some common managerial insights in the literature do not hold true anymore for example we have shown that the wholesale price from the supplier is not strictly decreasing in terms of the buyers order quantity under the wholesale contract we have shown that there is a critical positive initial inventory level at the buyers location such that the buyer has an incentive to report a higher initial inventory level to the supplier if and only if the initial inventory level is below this critical positive initial inventory level then under this untrue reporting we have shown that the buyer is always better off but the supplier is always worse off most people may think that the performance of the chain will be reduced because of the untrue reporting but we have shown that the performance of the chain is increased if the price sensitive demand is isoelastic type and the initial inventory level at the buyers location is low

this study aims to investigate overall supply chain network resilience scnr in the presence of ripple effect or risk propagation ie the phenomenon that disruptions at a few firms in a supply chain network scn can spread to their neighboring firms then eventually spread to other firms in the scn we begin by developing a multidimensional quantitative framework to measure scnr which includes three resilience dimensions based on three different network performance indicators given this framework we then systematically explore the determining factors of scnr and present a comprehensive analysis of how network structure and node risk capacity influence different aspects of scnr our results clearly indicate the following important implications for managers first the influence of network type on scnr tends to be more significant in the shortterm than it is in the longerterm given the ripple effect second scnr can be improved more effectively by enhancing node risk capacity than by adjusting network structure third tradeoffs exist between the robustness of the network against a disruption and its ability to recover from that disruption fourth different network performance indicators can provide different perspectives on scnr together these help show that the multidimensional framework enables a better characterization of the complexity of scnr and thus that it provides support for more informed managerial decisionmaking about investing in improving resilience the paper concludes the discussion by addressing opportunities for further extending the research effort elsevier bv
to meet consumer expectations for greener and better quality products and to ensure effective compliance with emissions regulations firms have begun investing in improving the quality and greenness low carbon level of existing products emissions regulations currently restrict carbon emissions from product manufacturing rather than the emissions from the use of sold products however a large amount of carbon may be emitted from the use of products motivated by these issues we analytically investigate the impact of environmental concern and the policies of regulators and consumer environmental concern on product introduction our results show that i whether emissions trading regulations benefit firms depends on the quality improvement capability and the interaction between emissions price and allowed emissions cap ii the environmental concern of consumers helps firms obtain higher profits when quality improvement capability is relatively high and always benefits environmental performance and iii relatively low environmental concern set by regulators is detrimental to the maximization of social welfare whereas high regulator environmental concern helps to maximize social welfare but at the expense of reducing firms profits elsevier bv
we consider the production control problem of a productioninventory system with correlated demand interarrival and processing times that are modeled as markovian arrival processes the control problem is minimizing the expected average cost of the system in the steadystate by controlling when to produce an available part we prove that the optimal control policy is the statedependent threshold policy we evaluate the performance of the system controlled by the statedependent threshold policy by using the matrix geometric method we determine the optimal threshold levels of the system by using policy iteration we then investigate how the autocorrelation of the arrival and service processes impact the performance of the system finally we compare the performance of the optimal policy with benchmark policies a statedependent policy that uses the distribution of the interevent times but assumes iidinterevent times a singlethreshold policy that uses both the distribution and also the autocorrelation and a singlethreshold policy that uses the distribution of the interevent times but assumes they are not correlated our analysis demonstrates that ignoring autocorrelation in setting the parameters of the production policy causes significant errors in the expected inventory and backlog costs a singlethreshold policy that sets the threshold based on the distribution and also the autocorrelation performs satisfactorily for systems with negative autocorrelation however ignoring positive correlation yields high errors for the total cost our study shows that an effective production control policy must take correlations in service and demand processes into account the authors

when organizations introduce programs to trade in old products for remanufactured ones to promote remanufacturing they offer two options to consumers buying new products or trading in for remanufactured products where the latter is a new practice while most of the extant literature considers only the single reference price effect there are quality differences in the problem of trading in for remanufactured products thus the reference quality effect cannot be overlooked as before to handle this new setting we consider consumers double reference effects to examine a manufacturer selling both new and remanufactured products we also consider the remanufacturing subsidy and the consumer rebate ratio we analyze five models and develop equilibrium solutions thereof to understand the impacts of double reference parameters and government incentives on pricing strategies the manufacturers profits and the consumer surplus computational examples reveal that i both the manufacturers profits and the consumer surplus benefit from the double reference effects when the reference price parameter is relatively larger and the reference quality parameter is relatively smaller ii the remanufacturing subsidy is beneficial to the manufacturer and the consumer rebate ratio only impacts and improves the retail prices of remanufactured products but does not change the profits of the manufacturer iii when the customers only consider reference price effect lower unit remanufacturing cost higher remanufacturing rates and lower consumers discount rates for remanufactured products benefit the manufacturer surprisingly when only the reference quality effect behavior is considered higher unit remanufacturing cost lower remanufacturing rates and higher customers discount rates can offset some of the negative impacts of reference quality effects

the existing literature has shown that an increase in the demand for safe assets induces the private sector to create more of them focusing on repos backed by us treasuries i theoretically and empirically show that an increase in the demand for safe assets leads to a decrease in repos outstanding because treasuries are safe assets an increase in the demand for safe assets compresses their term premia reducing incentives to issue repos thus the sensitivity of private safe asset creation depends on whether the collateral backing them are safe assets themselves the sensitivity of the federal reserves reverse repurchase agreement rrp operations has the same sign as existing studies
we develop a novel method to dynamically hedge foreign exchange exposure in international equity and bond portfolios the method exploits the timeseries predictability of currency returns which we show emerges from exploiting a forecastable component in global factor returns the hedging strategy outperforms leading alternative approaches to currency hedging across a large set of performance metrics moreover we find that exploiting currency return predictability via an independent currency portfolio delivers a high riskadjusted return and provides superior diversification gains to global equity and bond investors relative to currency carry value and momentum investment strategies elsevier bv
the likelihood of seasoned equity offerings seos jumps discontinuously when the stock price equals the most recent equity offer price anchoring on the last offer price holds after considering executive turnovers stock splits earnings management or dividend adjustments using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around this cutoff which exploits local randomness in stock prices we investigate the consequences of anchoring in seos we find significant increases in cash holdings and acquisitions of lower quality with no real effects on investment or employment overall we provide some of the cleanest estimates to date of the timing and causal effects of seos elsevier ltd
the promise of contingent convertible capital securities cocos as a bailin solution has been the subject of considerable theoretical analysis and debate but little is known about their effects in practice we undertake the first comprehensive empirical analysis of bank coco issues a market segment that comprises over instruments totaling billion four main findings emerge the propensity to issue a coco is higher for larger and better capitalized banks coco issues result in a statistically significant decline in issuers cds spread indicating that they generate riskreduction benefits and lower costs of debt this is especially true for cocos that convert into equity have mechanical triggers and are classified as additional tier instruments cocos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on cds spreads and coco issues have no statistically significant impact on stock prices except for principal writedown cocos with a high trigger level which have a positive effect elsevier bv
the price of discount rate risk reveals whether increases in equity risk premia represent good or bad news to rational investors employing a new empirical methodology we find that the price is negative which suggests that discount rates are high during times of high marginal utility of wealth our approach relies on using future realized market returns to consistently estimate covariances of asset returns with the market risk premium covariances drive observed patterns in a broad cross section of stock and bond expected returns elsevier bv
we develop a parsimonious model to study the effect of regulations aimed at reducing counterparty risk on the structure of overthecounter securities markets we find that such regulations promote entry of dealers thus fostering competition and lowering spreads greater competition however has an indirect negative effect on marketmaking profitability general equilibrium effects imply that more competition can distort incentives of all dealers to invest in efficient technologies ex ante and so can cause a social welfare loss our results are consistent with empirical findings on the effects of postcrisis regulations and with the opposition of some market participants to those regulations elsevier bv
this paper examines the joint determination of deviations in longterm covered interest rate parity and differences in the credit spread of bonds of similar risk but different currency denomination these two pricing anomalies are highly aligned in both the time series and the crosssection of currencies the sum of these two pricing deviations the corporate basis represents the currencyhedged borrowing cost difference between currency regions and explains up to a third of the variation in the aggregate corporate debt issuance flow i show that arbitrage aimed at exploiting one type of security anomaly can give rise to the other
do stock prices of publicly listed companies respond to changes in transaction costs using the secs pilot program that increased the tick size for approximately randomly chosen stocks we find a stock price decrease between and for small spread stocks affected by the larger tick size relative to a control group we find that the increase in the present value of transaction costs accounts for a small percentage of the price decrease we study channels of price variation due to changes in expected returns information risk investor horizon and liquidity risk the evidence suggests that trading frictions affect the cost of capital the authors
i present a model in which bank net worth determines both loan market competition and monetary transmission to firm borrowing rates in the model banks are local monopolists for borrowers near them when they are flush with equity banks expand their lending compete for customers at the edges of their markets and pass through changes in the monetary policy rate to their loan rates when they lose substantial equity banks consolidate retreat from rivalry and frustrate monetary transmission the model explains why interest rate passthrough weakens after financial crises its predictions are consistent with several facts about banktofirm lending elsevier bv
is there a gap between the profitability of a trading strategy on paper and that which is achieved in practice we answer this question by developing a general technique to measure the realworld implementation costs of financial market anomalies our method extends famamacbeth regressions to compare the onpaper returns to factor exposures with those achieved by mutual funds unlike existing approaches ours delivers estimates of allin implementation costs without relying on parametric microstructure models or explicitly specified factor trading strategies after accounting for implementation costs typical mutual funds earn low returns to value and no returns to momentum
corporate bond mutual funds engage in liquidity transformation raising concerns among academics and policy makers that large redemptions will lead to asset fire sales we find little evidence however that bond fund redemptions drive fire sale price pressure after controlling for timevarying issuerlevel information that could also affect funds trading decisions using a novel identification strategy that exploits sameissuer bonds held by funds with differing outflows we attribute our findings which contrast with those found for equity funds to funds liquidity management strategies bond funds maintain significant liquidity cushions and selectively trade liquid assets allowing them to absorb investor redemption risk without excessively liquidating corporate bonds even during the financial crisis elsevier bv
in the us department of labor imposed new disclosure requirements for indirect fees that k retirement plan service providers earn through revenue sharing agreements with mutual funds this paper examines the impact of these fee disclosure requirements on the level and structure of fees paid by retirement plans as well as service providers ability to price discriminate between plan sponsors of different sophistication we document that the new disclosure requirements are associated with a substitution of direct fees for indirect fees and a reduction in total fees paid by smaller plans and that mutual fund providers responded by introducing retirement fund share classes with lower b fees
starting with the fundamental relation that state prices are the product of physical probabilities and the stochastic discount factor ross shows that given strong assumptions knowing state prices suffices to back out physical probabilities and the stochastic discount factor at the same time we find that such recovered physical distributions based on the sp index are incompatible with future returns and fail to predict future returns and realized variances these negative results are even stronger when we add economically reasonable constraints simple benchmark methods based on a power utility agent or the historical return distribution cannot be rejected elsevier bv
how and to what extent do managerial control benefits shape the efficiency of the takeover market we revisit this question by estimating both the dark and bright sides of managerial control benefits in an industry equilibrium model on the dark side managers private benefits of control distort firms takeover incentives and hinder the reallocation role of the takeover market on the bright side fear of a takeover induces underperforming managers to exert more effort and enhances the disciplinary role of the takeover market our estimates suggest that the brightside effect increases the value created by an active takeover market by comparable in magnitude to the darkside effect it is also important to account for this brightside effect in explaining certain features of the takeover market including a low takeoverperformance sensitivity
a central challenge in the regulation of controlled firms is curbing rent extraction by controllers as independent directors and fiduciary duties are often insufficient some jurisdictions give minority shareholders veto rights over relatedparty transactions to assess these rights effectiveness we exploit a israeli reform that gave minority shareholders veto rights over relatedparty transactions including the pay of controllers and their relatives controller executives we find that the reform curbed controllerexecutive pay and led some controller executives to resign or go with little or no pay in circumstances suggesting their pay would be rejected these findings suggest that minority veto rights can be an effective corporate governance tool
an important milestone often reached in the life of an activist engagement is entering into a settlement agreement between the activist and the targets board using a comprehensive handcollected data set we analyze the drivers nature and consequences of such settlement agreements settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents reputation concerns are stronger consistent with incomplete contracting facesaving benefits and private information considerations settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists including ceo turnover higher shareholder payouts and improved operating performance we find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors our analysis provides a look into the black box of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies elsevier bv
applying standard portfoliosort techniques to bank asset returns for countries from to we uncover a risk premium associated with implicit government guarantees this risk premium is intimately tied to sovereign risk suggesting that guaranteed banks defined as those of particular importance to the national economy inherit the risk of the guarantor indeed this premium does not exist in safehaven countries we rationalize these findings with a model in which implicit government guarantees are risky in the sense that they provide protection that depends on the aggregate state of the economy elsevier bv

we develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of other creditors we find that paradoxically borrowers rely most on collateral when pledgeability is high this is when taking on new debt is easy which dilutes existing creditors creditors thus require collateral for protection against possible dilution by collateralized debt there is a collateral rat race but collateralized borrowing has a cost it encumbers assets constraining future borrowing and investment there is a collateral overhang our results suggest that policies aimed at increasing the supply of collateral can backfire triggering an inefficient collateral rat race likewise upholding the absolute priority of secured debt can exacerbate the rat race
we find that corporate loan contracts frequently concentrate control rights with a subset of lenders despite the rise in term loans without financial covenants socalled covenantlite loans borrowing firms revolving lines of credit almost always retain traditional financial covenants this split structure gives revolving lenders the exclusive right and ability to monitor and to renegotiate the financial covenants and we confirm that loans with split control rights are still subject to the discipline of financial covenants we provide evidence that split control rights are designed to mitigate bargaining frictions that have arisen with the entry of nonbank lenders and became apparent during the financial crisis elsevier bv
we explore the labor market effects of gender and race by examining board leadership appointments prior studies are often limited by observing only hired candidates whereas the boardroom provides a controlled setting where both hired and unhired candidates are observable although diverse female and minority board representation has increased diverse directors are significantly less likely to serve in leadership positions despite possessing stronger qualifications than nondiverse directors while specialized skills such as prior leadership or finance experience increase the likelihood of appointment that likelihood is reduced for diverse directors additional tests provide no evidence that diverse directors are less effective
investor preferences for holding speculative assets are likely to be more pronounced ahead of firms earnings announcements probably because of lower inventory costs and immediate payoffs or because of enhanced investor attention we show that the demand for lotterylike stocks is stronger ahead of earnings announcements leading to a price runup for these stocks in sharp contrast to the standard underperformance of lotterylike stocks lotterylike stocks outperform nonlottery stocks by about basis points in the day window ahead of earnings announcements however this return spread is reversed by basis points in the day window after the announcements moreover this invertedvshaped pattern on cumulative return spreads is more pronounced among firms with a greater retail order imbalance among firms with low institutional ownership and in regions with a stronger gambling propensity and it is also robust after controlling for past month returns and various proxies for investor attention
we examine the value and efficiency of analyst recommendations through the lens of capital market anomalies we find that analysts do not fully use the information in anomaly signals when making recommendations analysts tend to give more favorable consensus recommendations to stocks classified as overvalued and more important these stocks subsequently tend to have particularly negative abnormal returns analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with anomaly signals are more skilled and elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns our findings suggest that analysts biased recommendations could be a source of market friction that impedes the efficient correction of mispricing
yes we show that dividend changes contain information about highly persistent changes in future economic income three methodological differences lead us to different conclusions from the extant literature i we use an event window approach to cleanly delineate earnings after dividend changes from those before ii we use alternative earnings measures to control for endogenous investment and asset writedowns surrounding dividend changes and iii we control for the nonlinear relation between dividend changes and market reactions our results suggest dividend announcement returns reflect information about the level of permanent earnings though the timing of the information content is difficult to reconcile with traditional signaling models
using data on over lowincome tax filers we estimate the effect of medicaid access on the propensity of households to save or repay debt from their tax refunds we instrument for medicaid access using variation in state eligibility rules we find substanital heterogeneity across households in the savings response to medicaid households that are not experiencing financial hardship behave in a manner consistent with a precautionary savings model meaning they save less under medicaid in contrast among households experiencing financial hardship medicaid eligibility increases refund savings rates by roughly percentage points or for both sets of households effects are stronger in states with lower bankruptcy exemption limits consistent with uninsured financially constrained households using bankruptcy to manage health expenditure risk our results imply that expansions to the social safety net may affect the magnitude of the consumption response to tax rebates elsevier bv

preemptive rights are thought to protect minority shareholders from cheapstock tunneling by a controlling shareholder we show that preemptive rights while making cheapstock tunneling more difficult cannot prevent it when asymmetric information about the value of the offered shares makes it impossible for the minority to know whether these shares are cheap or overpriced our analysis can help explain why sophisticated investors in unlisted firms and regulators of listed firms do not rely entirely on preemptive rights to address cheapstock tunneling supplementing them with other restrictions on equity issues elsevier bv
we analyze a model in which information may be voluntarily disclosed by a firm andor by a third party eg financial analysts due to its strategic nature corporate voluntary disclosure is qualitatively different from thirdparty disclosure greater analyst coverage crowds out crowds in corporate voluntary disclosure when analysts mostly discover information that is available unavailable to the firm nevertheless greater analyst coverage always improves the overall quality of public information we base this claim on two market quality measures price efficiency which is statistical in nature and liquidity which is derived in a trading stage that follows the disclosure stage elsevier bv
we study the impact of marital property legislation passed in the us south in the s on households investment in risky entrepreneurial projects these laws protected the assets of newly married women from creditors in a world of virtually unlimited liability we compare couples married after the passage of a marital property law with couples from the same state who were married before consistent with a simple model of household borrowing that trades off agency costs against risk sharing the effect on investment was heterogeneous it increased if most household property came from the husband and decreased if most came from the wife
we show that hedge funds gain an information advantage from their prime broker banks regarding the banks corporate borrowers the connected hedge funds make abnormally large trades in the stocks of borrowing firms prior to loan announcements and these trades outperform other trades the outperformance is particularly strong for trades of hedge funds that have high revenue potential for prime broker banks these informed trades appear to be based on information not just about the loan itself but also about firms fundamentals such as future earnings finally we find evidence suggesting that equity analysts inside the banks are one potential conduit of information transfer elsevier bv
this paper finds that stricter laws regulating thirdparty debt collection reduce the number of thirdparty debt collectors lower the recovery rates on delinquent credit card loans and lead to a modest decrease in the openings of new revolving lines of credit further stricter thirdparty debt collection laws are associated with fewer consumer lawsuits against thirdparty debt collectors but not with a reduction in the overall number of consumer complaints overall stricter thirdparty debt collection laws appear to restrict access to new revolving credit but have an ambiguous effect on the nonpecuniary costs that the debt collection process imposes on borrowers elsevier bv
past studies typically have focused on whether people perceive more rare risk after experiencing catastrophic disasters we show that people can also feel less risk with unexpected lucky disaster experience by exploring a novel identification strategy based on households expectations we find that households perceive less more risk when they experience disasters that have lower higher fatalities than what was expected this opposite experience effect of rare disasters is substantial a one standard deviation increase in the negative positive experience shock is associated with a decrease a increase in the life insurancetoportfolio ratio we discuss three possible mechanisms to account for our empirical findings incomplete information learning salience theory and change in risk preferences
using a comprehensive sample of credit card data from a leading chinese bank we show that government bureaucrats receive higher credit lines than nonbureaucrats with similar income and demographics but their accounts experience a significantly higher likelihood of delinquency and debt forgiveness regions associated with greater credit provision to bureaucrats open more branches and receive more deposits from the local government after staggered corruption crackdowns of provinciallevel political officials the new credit cards originated to bureaucrats in exposed regions do not enjoy a credit line premium and bureaucrats delinquency and reinstatement rates are similar to those of nonbureaucrats elsevier bv
we derive a measure that captures the extent to which common ownership shifts managers incentives to internalize externalities a key feature of the measure is that it allows for the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a managers actions benefit the investors overall portfolio empirically we show that potential drivers of common ownership including mergers in the asset management industry and under certain circumstances even indexing could diminish managerial motives to internalize externalities our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor inattention when analyzing whether the growth of common ownership affects managerial incentives
we find evidence consistent with previously unrecognized market manipulation by brokerdealers specifically we show that pretrade hedging which is distinct from frontrunning alters prices at which derivative trades occur we show this behavior is intentional by exploiting variation in the design of structured equity products seps we find positive abnormal returns on sep pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar seps we also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when sep issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices
we allow a strategic trader to choose when to acquire information about an assets payoff instead of endowing her with it when the trader dynamically controls the precision of a flow of information the optimal precision evolves stochastically and increases with market liquidity because the trader exploits her information gradually the equilibrium price impact and market uncertainty are unaffected by her rate of acquisition if she pays a fixed cost to acquire lumpy information at a time of her choosing the market can break down we show that no equilibria exist with endogenous information acquisition our analysis suggests caution when applying insights from standard strategic trading models to settings with information acquisition elsevier bv
we examine ceoboard dynamics using a new panel dataset that spans to the long sample allows us to perform withinfirm and withinceo tests over a long horizon many for the first time in the governance literature consistent with theories of bargaining or dynamic contracting we find board independence increases at ceo turnover and falls with ceo tenure with the decline stronger following superior performance ceos are also more likely to be appointed board chair as tenure increases and we find evidence consistent with a substitution between board independence and chair duality other results suggest that these classes of models fail to capture important elements of board dynamics first the magnitude of the ceo tenure effect is economically small much smaller for example than the strong persistence in board structure that we show second when external ceos are hired board independence falls and subsequently increases third event studies show a positive market reaction when powerful ceos die in office consistent with powerful ceos becoming entrenched
this paper develops a novel measure of liquidity supply by brokerdealers using data on their trading positions in treasury bonds and the deviations of treasury yields from a fitted yield curve the measure is informative about liquidity in other asset classes including corporate bonds and equities a decline in liquidity supply predicts reduced debt issuance and investment by nonfinancial firms and reduced aggregate economic activity the sensitivity of liquidity issuance and investment to brokerdealers liquidity supply is larger for firms with low credit quality the results suggest that securities intermediaries are important for understanding liquidity commonality corporate financing and real activity
we show that in the limitedcommitment framework of donaldson et al firm value always increases in the fraction of cash flows that can be pledged as collateral that is pledgeability increases investment efficiency and relaxes a firms financing constraint we derive this conclusion using the same contracts considered by the authors and generalize the result to an arbitrary number of states we also show that the first best can always be implemented by a nonstatecontingent secured debt contract which differs from the ones they consider elsevier bv
we study the effects of collateral constraints in an economy populated by investors with nonpledgeable labor incomes and heterogeneous preferences and beliefs we show that these constraints inflate stock prices and generate spikes and crashes in pricedividend ratios and volatilities clustering of volatilities and leverage cycles they also lead to substantial decreases in interest rates and increases in sharpe ratios when investors are anxious about hitting constraints due to production crises in the economy furthermore stock prices have large collateral premiums over nonpledgeable incomes we derive asset prices and stationary distributions of the investors consumption shares in closed form elsevier bv
we use investmentlevel data to study performance persistence in venture capital vc consistent with prior studies we find that each additional initial public offering ipo among a vc firms first ten investments predicts as much as an higher ipo rate on its subsequent investments though this effect erodes with time in exploring its sources we document several additional facts successful outcomes stem in large part from investing in the right places at the right times vc firms do not persist in their ability to choose the right places and times to invest but early success does lead to investing in later rounds and in larger syndicates this pattern of results seems most consistent with the idea that initial success improves access to deal flow that preferential access raises the quality of subsequent investments perpetuating performance differences in initial investments the authors
to assess the importance of inflation risk for nominal treasury yields a novel quadratic term structure model with timevarying inflation risk is estimated using surveybased inflation uncertainty the resulting yield decomposition captures very diverse macroeconomic dynamics of inflation and real risk premiums large and positive during the s but small and negative post and generates sensible highfrequency estimates of expected inflation and real short rates over a long sample the explicit link between the modelimplied factors and macro fundamentals reveals that short but not longrun fluctuations are unspanned by yields consistent with an interest rate policy unresponsive to transient inflation shocks

we investigate the transmission of central bank liquidity to bank deposits and loan spreads in europe over the period from january to june we find evidence consistent with an impaired transmission channel due to bank risk central bank liquidity does not translate into lower loan spreads for highrisk banks for maturities beyond one year even as it lowers deposit spreads for both high and lowrisk banks this adversely affects the balance sheets of highrisk bank borrowers leading to lower payouts lower capital expenditures and lower employment overall our results suggest that banks capital constraints at the time of an easing of monetary policy pose a challenge to the effectiveness of the banklending channel and the central banks lender of last resort function
historically a key advantage of being a public firm was broader access to capital from a disperse group of shareholders in recent years such capital has increasingly become available to private firms as well we document a dramatic increase over the past twenty years in the number of mutual funds participating in private markets and in the dollar value of these private firm investments we evaluate several factors that potentially contribute to this trend firms seeking extra capital to postpone public listing mutual funds seeking higher riskadjusted returns and initial public offering ipo allocations and venture capitalists vcs seeking new investors to substantiate higher valuations results indicate that the first two factors play a significant role
does democratization reduce the cost of credit using global syndicated loan data from to we find that democratization has a sizable negative effect on loan spreads a point increase in the zerototen polity iv index of democracy shaves at least basis points off spreads but likely more reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization and to a battery of other sensitivity tests we thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization can affect economic development

using a novel database that tracks web traffic on the security exchange commissions edgar server between and we show that institutional investors gather information on a very particular subset of firms and insiders and their surveillance is very persistent over time this tracking behavior has powerful implications for their portfolio choice and its information content an institution that downloaded an insider trading filing by a given firm last quarter increases its likelihood of downloading an insider trading filing on the same firm by more than percentage points this quarter moreover the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized alphas of over relative to the purchase of an average non tracked stock we find that institutional managers tend to track top executives and to share educational and locational commonalities with the specific insiders they choose to follow collectively our results suggest that the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm value and is only revealed following the informationrich dual trading by insiders and linked institutions

we use mergerinduced changes to shareholder structure to test for active catering to dividend clienteles following mergers acquirers adjust their dividend payout toward that of the target but only when they inherit target shareholders through stock swaps this adjustment is stronger when legacy shareholders are more influential and reveal a greater preference for dividends through portfolio holdings and trading behavior countrylevel differences in dividend taxes governance quality and population age further shape the extent of adjustment in ways consistent with dividend preferences preclosing differences in dividend payout discourage the use of stock as a payment method
we find a significant positive relation between changes in policy uncertainty and changes in credit spreads macroeconomic conditions including general uncertainty do not explain this result which also holds when we use instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues the impact of policy uncertainty is greater for firms that operate in regulationintensive industries face high tax rates or are dependent on government spending it is also stronger for firms that engage in political activities or rely on external financing we conclude that policy uncertainty has a significant effect on firms borrowing costs with exposure to government policies representing an important channel elsevier bv
we study how sophisticated investors when faced with shocks to information environment change their information acquisition and trading behavior and how these changes in turn affect market efficiency we find that after exogenous reductions of analyst coverage due to closures and mergers of brokerage firms hedge funds scale up information acquisition trade more aggressively and earn higher abnormal returns on the affected stocks the hedge fund participation also mitigates the impairment of market efficiency caused by coverage reductions overall in a causal framework our findings suggest a substitution effect between sophisticated investors and public information providers in facilitating market efficiency elsevier bv
management directly or indirectly learns from its firms stock price so a more informative stock price should make the firm more productive we show that stock price informativeness increases firm productivity we provide direct evidence of one channel through which stock price informativeness affects productivity specifically we find that ceo turnover is less sensitive to tobins q when informativeness is lower we predict and confirm that the productivity of smaller and younger firms better governed firms more specialized firms and firms with more competition is more strongly related to the informativeness of their stock price we further address endogeneity concerns with the use of brokerage closures sp additions and mutual fund redemptions as plausibly exogenous events elsevier bv
we find a strong link between currency excess returns and the relative strength of the business cycle buying currencies of strong economies and selling currencies of weak economies generates high returns both in the crosssection and time series of countries these returns stem primarily from spot exchange rate predictability are uncorrelated with common currency investment strategies and cannot be understood using traditional currency risk factors in either unconditional or conditional asset pricing tests we also show that a business cycle factor implied by our results is priced in a broad currency cross section
we present a general equilibrium model of banks optimal capital structure where bankruptcy is costly and investors have heterogeneous endowments and incur a cost for participating in equity markets we show that besides its social benefits capital regulation benefits bank shareholders when it resolves fire sales externalities but not when it acts as a tax on bank profits such as when used to control excessive leverage induced by deposit insurance furthermore capital regulation widens the gap between the returns to bank shareholders and depositors and may reduce investments in projects in favor of storage

this paper examines the effect of ceos outside opportunities on the use of relative performance evaluation rpe in ceo compensation my tests exploit the staggered rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine idd by us state courts as an exogenous increase in ceos outside opportunities i find that the rejection of the idd leads to a significant increase in the sensitivity of ceo pay to systematic performance less rpe this increase is more pronounced for ceos with greater labor market mobility and industries where proprietary information is more important and not related to measures of governance quality these results suggest that firms link ceo pay to systematic performance to retain talent and ensure participation
this paper explores the creation and evolution of new stock exchanges around the world geared toward entrepreneurial companies known as secondtier exchanges using handcollected novel data we show the proliferation of these exchanges in many countries their significant volume of initial public offerings ipos and lower listing requirements shareholder protection strongly predicted exchange success even in countries with high levels of venture capital activity patenting and financial market development better shareholder protection allowed younger lessprofitable but fastergrowing companies to raise more capital these results highlight the importance of institutions in enabling the provision of entrepreneurial capital to young companies
we challenge the view that shortterm debt curbs moral hazard and demonstrate that in a world with financing frictions and fair debt pricing shortterm debt generates incentives for risktaking to do so we develop a model in which firms are financed with equity and shortterm debt and cannot freely optimize their default decision because of financing frictions we show that when firms are close to distress the dynamic interaction of operating and rollover losses fuels default risk in such instances shareholders find it optimal to increase asset risk to improve interim debt repricing and prevent inefficient liquidation these risktaking incentives do not arise when debt maturity is sufficiently long elsevier bv
we study tradeoffs among active mutual funds characteristics in both our equilibrium model and the data funds with larger size lower expense ratio and higher turnover hold moreliquid portfolios portfolio liquidity a concept introduced here depends not only on the liquidity of the portfolios holdings but also on the portfolios diversification we also confirm other modelpredicted tradeoffs larger funds are cheaper larger and cheaper funds are less active based on our new measure of activeness betterdiversified funds hold lessliquid stocks they are also larger and cheaper and they trade more these tradeoffs provide novel evidence of diseconomies of scale in active management elsevier bv
offbalance sheet financing of an investment is covered by limited liability whereas onbalance sheet financing creates unlimited liability towards the banks assetinplace offbalance sheet funding thus gives the bank flexibility to voluntarily support debt repayments when the investment fails which allows the bank to signal information about the quality of its future projects improving investment efficiency yet limited liability reduces the banks effort incentives offbalance sheet funding with voluntary support is optimal for activities that are rapidly growing or negatively correlated with existing assets the model yields testable predictions on the relationship between offbalance sheet debt spreads and sponsors characteristics elsevier bv
i examine how the labor market in which firms operate affects their capital structure decisions based on us census bureau data and information on companies decisions to locate their new operations i use a large plant opening as an abrupt increase in the size of a local labor market i find that a new plant opening leads to an increase of percentage points in the debttocapital ratio of existing firms in the winner county relative to the runnerup choice this result is consistent with the argument that larger labor markets make job loss less costly which in turn reduces the indirect costs of financial distress notably this spillover effect is larger for firms that employ the same type of workers as the new plant in the affected county
fiscal policy matters for bond risk premia empirically government spending level and uncertainty predict bond excess returns as well as term structure level and slope movements shocks to government spending level and uncertainty are also priced in the crosssection of bond and stock portfolios theoretically government spending level shocks raise inflation when marginal utility is high thus generating positive inflation risk premia term structure level effect uncertainty shocks steepen the yield curve slope effect producing positive term premia these effects are consistent with evidence from a structural vector autoregression asset pricing tests using model simulated data corroborate our empirical findings elsevier bv
blockholders play a large role in corporate governance we examine their voting behavior by adding a voter with many votes ie a blockholder to a standard voting model a blockholder may not vote with all of her shares this is efficient because it prevents her from drowning out the information in others votes this effect holds even when shares may be traded consequently regulations prohibiting abstention will harm information aggregation though such regulations may promote information acquisition by blockholders we extend the model by allowing the blockholder to announce her information upfront the possibility of blockholder bias and asymmetric priors
existing research has found crosssectional seasonality of stock returns the periodic outperformance of certain stocks during the same calendar months or weekdays we hypothesize that assets different sensitivities to investor mood explain these effects and imply other seasonalities consistent with our hypotheses relative performance across individual stocks or portfolios during past high or low mood months and weekdays tends to recur in periods with congruent mood and reverse in periods with noncongruent mood furthermore assets with higher sensitivities to aggregate mood higher mood betas subsequently earn higher returns during ascending mood periods and earn lower returns during descending mood periods
we examine how capital gains taxes affect investment in private startup ie preipo firms using data on capital raised in individual funding rounds we estimate the effect of the sbja which implemented a full exemption from federal capital gains tax on the sale of qualified shares because of the resulting higher expected aftertax returns we hypothesize and find evidence consistent with this capital gains tax reduction increasing the amount of investment in startup firms per funding round by about the effect is stronger in startup firms that are likely to have greater administrative capacity we estimate that about onethird of the tax benefit is captured by investors
this paper examines whether predictable seasonal patterns in firm fundamentals generate time variation in stock returns our findings indicate that stock returns are counterseasonal specifically a longshort strategy of buying lowsales season stocks and shorting highsales season stocks produces an annual alpha of over the last decade this seasonal effect has a relatively high sharpe ratio and occurs independently of previously documented seasonal anomalies we analyze several possible hypotheses for this phenomenon
most shortterm interest rates in the euro area are below the european central bank deposit facility rate the rate at which the central bank remunerates banks for excess reserves this coincided with the start of the public sector purchase program pspp launched in march in this paper we explore empirically the interactions between the pspp and repo rates using proprietary data from pspp purchases and repo transactions for specific special securities we assess the scarcity channel of pspp and its impact on repo rates we estimate that purchasing of a bond outstanding is associated with a decline of its repo rate of basis points
venture capital an important source of financing for potentially highgrowth new businesses is believed to suffer from information frictions this paper quantifies the magnitude of these frictions among participants in new venture competitions in a regression discontinuity design with data from competitions winning a round increases the chances of external financing by about winning is most impactful for ventures that are ranked just above the cutoff but receive no cash prize and judge ranks strongly predict venture success the results indicate that these information problems in new venture finance are large and competitions can help resolve them through certification elsevier bv
the doddfrank act mandates that certain standard overthecounter otc derivatives must be traded on swap execution facilities sefs using messagelevel data we provide a granular analysis of dealers and customers trading behavior on the two largest dealertocustomer sefs for index credit default swaps cds on average a typical customer contacts few dealers when seeking liquidity a theoretical model shows that the benefit of competition through wider order exposure is mitigated by a winners curse problem and dealercustomer relationships consistent with the model we find that order size market conditions and customerdealer relationships are important empirical determinants of customers choice of trading mechanism and dealers liquidity provision elsevier bv
this paper examines how housing market distress affects job search using data from a leading online job search platform during the great recession we find that job seekers in areas with depressed housing markets apply for fewer jobs that require relocation with their search constrained geographically job seekers broaden their search for lowerlevel positions nearby these effects are stronger for job seekers with recourse mortgages which we confirm using a spatial regression discontinuity analysis our findings suggest that housing market distress distorts labor market outcomes by impeding households ability to move elsevier bv
we study informational freeriding in a model where agents privately acquire information and then decide when to reveal it by taking an action examples of such freeriding are prevalent in financial markets eg the timing of initial public offerings analysts forecasts and mutual funds investment decisions the main results show that in large populations few agents provide significant information while the vast majority of agents freeride we highlight the role of uncertainty and market size in shaping the dynamics of price discovery among other results we find that heightened uncertainty over the underlying state enhances information production yet weakens the precision and speed of information aggregation in the market elsevier bv
using a novel pairwise measure of firms acquisition of rivals disclosures we show that investment opportunities drive interfirm information flows we find that these flows predict subsequent mergers and acquisitions as well as how and how much firms invest relative to rivals moreover firms use of rivals information often hinges on the similarities of their products our results suggest that rivals public information far from being unusable helps facilitate investment and product decisions including acquisitions and product differentiation strategies the findings also support a learning mechanism that could partly underlie the emerging literature on peer investment effects
we derive lower and upper bounds on the conditional expected excess market return that are related to riskneutral volatility skewness and kurtosis indexes the bounds can be calculated in real time using a cross section of option prices the bounds require a noarbitrage assumption but they do not depend on distributional assumptions about market returns or past observations the bounds are highly volatile positively skewed and fattailed they imply that the term structure of expected excess holding period returns is decreasing during turbulent times and increasing during normal times and that the expected excess market return is on average elsevier bv
the upsurge of shadow banking is typically driven by rising financing demand from certain real sectors in china the trillion yuan stimulus package in was behind the rapid growth of shadow banking after expediting the development of chinese corporate bond markets in the poststimulus period chinese local governments financed the stimulus through bank loans in and then resorted to nonbank debt financing after when faced with rollover pressure from bank debt coming due crosssectionally using a politicaleconomybased instrument we show that provinces with greater bank loan growth in experienced more municipal corporate bond issuance during together with more shadow banking activities including trustloans and wealth management products chinas poststimulus experience exhibits similarities to financial market development during the us national banking era
we show that inflation risk is priced in stock returns and that inflation risk premia in the crosssection and the aggregate market vary over time even changing sign as in the early s this time variation is due to both price and quantities of inflation risk changing over time using a consumptionbased asset pricing model we argue that inflation risk is priced because inflation predicts real consumption growth the historical changes in this predictability and in stocks inflation betas can account for the size variability predictability and sign reversals in inflation risk premia elsevier bv
we study the consequences of a change in the investment adviser qualification exam that reallocated coverage from the rules and ethics section to the technical material section comparing advisers with the same employer in the same location and year we find those passing the exam with more rules and ethics coverage are onefourth less likely to commit misconduct the exam change appears to affect advisers perception of acceptable conduct and not just their awareness of specific rules or selection into the qualification those passing the rules and ethicsfocused exam are more likely to depart employers experiencing scandals such departures also predict future scandals our paper offers the first archival evidence on how rules and ethics training affects conduct and labor market activity in the financial sector elsevier bv
using a comprehensive list of terrorist attacks over three decades we find that aggregate investor risk aversion inversely relates to terrorist activity in the united states a one standard deviation increase in the number of attacks each month leads to a million drop in aggregate flows to equity funds and a million increase to government bond funds tests on alternative channels further suggest that the shift in aggregate risk aversion is driven mainly by an emotional shock rather than changes in wealth or the outside environment we also investigate possible alternate explanations for reduced flows to risky assets our evidence is consistent with a fearinduced increase in aggregate risk aversion elsevier bv
we analyze the economic and financial impact of righttowork rtw laws in the us using data from collective bargaining agreements we show that there is a decrease in wages for unionized workers after rtw laws firms increase investment and employment but reduce financial leverage laborintensive firms experience higher profits and labortoasset ratios dividends and executive compensation also increase postrtw our results are consistent with a canonical theory of the firm augmented with an exogenous bargaining power of labor and suggest that rtw laws impact corporate policies by decreasing that bargaining power elsevier bv
we develop a valuation model for venture capitalbacked companies and apply it to us unicorns that is private companies with reported valuations above billion we value unicorns using financial terms from legal filings and find that reported unicorn postmoney valuations average above fair value with being more than above reported valuations assume that all shares are as valuable as the most recently issued preferred shares we calculate values for each share class which yields lower valuations because most unicorns gave recent investors major protections such as initial public offering ipo return guarantees vetoes over downipos or seniority to all other investors common shares lack all such protections and are overvalued after adjusting for these valuationinflating terms almost onehalf out of of unicorns lose their unicorn status elsevier bv
the total effects of a regulatory change consist of direct effects and indirect effects spillovers but the standard differenceindifference approach mostly ignores potential indirect effects during the full repeal of the uptick rule shortsellers become much more aggressive across the board even in control stocks where the uptick rule is already suspended this finding is consistent with positive and significant indirect effects on control stocks likely driven by aggressive broad listbased shorting in contract the indirect effect coefficients on shorting aggressiveness are negative for the partial uptick repeal possibly due to substitutions between control and treatment stocks elsevier bv
we develop three novel measures of the incentives of equity mutual funds to internalize the price impact of their trading we show that mutual funds with stronger incentives to internalize their price impact accommodate inflows and outflows by adjusting their cash buffers instead of trading in portfolio securities as a result stocks held by these funds have lower volatility and flows out of these funds have smaller spillover effects on other funds holding the same securities our results provide evidence of meaningful fire sale externalities in the equity mutual fund industry
average delta hedged returns for standard poors index options are large per day when we decompose these option returns into intraday and overnight components average closetoopen returns are per day and opentoclose returns are positive a similar return pattern holds for all maturity and moneyness categories and equity options these positive intraday returns are particularly difficult to explain however our results are consistent with option prices failing to account for the wellknown fact that stock volatility is substantially higher intraday than overnight these findings help explain price formation in the options market
using manager compensation disclosure and intrafamily manager cooperation measures we create indices of familylevel competitivecooperative incentives families that encourage cooperation among their managers are more likely to engage in coordinated behavior eg crosstrading and crossholding and have less volatile cash flows families with competitive incentives generate higher performing funds a higher fraction of star funds but greater performance dispersion across funds in examining the determinants of incentive schemes competitive families are more likely to manage institutional money and cooperative families are more likely to distribute through brokers consistent with retail demand for nonperformance characteristics elsevier bv
this paper studies the effects of financial distress on workers productivity using detailed data from the public school system in texas we show that the student passing rate in the mediansized grade decreases by percentage points following a declaration of bankruptcy by one teacher in the grade the effect of financial distress increases with the complexity of the task overall our results suggest a potential feedback effect of worker financial distress on local economic conditions and thus contribute to the understanding of the propagation and potential amplification of shocks through a local economy the authors
this study uses two distinct quasinatural experiments to examine the effect of institutional shareholders on corporate social responsibility csr we first find that an exogenous increase in institutional holding caused by russell index reconstitutions improves portfolio firms csr performance we then find that firms have lower csr ratings when shareholders are distracted due to exogenous shocks moreover the effect of institutional ownership is stronger in csr categories that are financially material furthermore we show that institutional shareholders influence csr through csrrelated proposals overall our results suggest that institutional shareholders can generate real social impact
how do changes in a rating agencys reputation affect the ratings market we study the dynamics of credit ratings after standard poors sp was shut out of a large segment of the commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs ratings market following a procedural mistake exploiting the fact that most cmbs have ratings from multiple agencies we show that sp subsequently eased its standards compared to other raters this coincided with a partial recovery in the number of deals sp was hired to rate our findings suggest that an agency can regain market share after suffering reputational damage by issuing optimistic ratings elsevier bv
we introduce a theoretical model of the active fund management industry afmi in which performance and size depend on the afmis competitiveness concentration under plausible assumptions as afmis concentration decreases so do fund managers incentives for exerting effort in search of alpha consequently managers produce lower gross alpha and rational investors inferring lower expected afmi performance allocate a smaller portion of their wealth to active funds empirically we find that a decrease in the us mutual fund industry concentration over our sample period is associated with a decrease in its net alpha and size relative to stock market capitalization elsevier bv
this paper investigates employment effects of the federal reserves quantitative easing policies qe via a bank lending channel we find that banks with higher mortgagebacked securities holdings refinanced relatively more mortgages after the first round of qe which increased local consumption and employment in the nontradable goods sector in contrast banks increased lending to firms and home purchase mortgage origination after the third round of qe which led to a sizable increase in overall employment our findings are supported by new confidential loanlevel data that show firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more during qe

we document a new phenomenon in bond and equity markets that we call crossasset time series momentum using data from countries we show that past bond market returns are positive predictors of future equity market returns and past equity market returns are negative predictors of future bond market returns we use this predictability to construct a diversified crossasset time series momentum portfolio that yields a sharpe ratio higher than a standard time series momentum portfolio we present evidence that time series momentum and crossasset time series momentum are driven by slowmoving capital in bond and equity markets
we construct a robust stochastic discount factor sdf summarizing the joint explanatory power of a large number of crosssectional stock return predictors our method achieves robust outofsample performance in this highdimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on sdf coefficients that shrinks contributions of lowvariance principal components of the candidate characteristicsbased factors we find that characteristicssparse sdfs formed from a few such factors eg the four or fivefactor models in the recent literature cannot adequately summarize the crosssection of expected stock returns however an sdf formed from a small number of principal components performs well elsevier bv
investors increasingly look for private equity managers to provide opportunities for coinvesting outside the fund structure thereby saving fees and carried interest payments in this paper we use a large sample of buyout and venture capital coinvestments to test how such deals compare with the remaining fund investments in contrast to fang ivashina and lerner we find no evidence of adverse selection gross return distributions of coinvestments and other deals are similar coinvestments generally have lower costs to investors we simulate net returns to investors and demonstrate how reasonably sized portfolios of coinvestments significantly outperform fund returns
postcrisis stress tests have altered banks credit supply to small business banks most affected by stress tests reallocate credit away from riskier markets and toward safer ones they also raise interest rates on small loans quantities fall most in highrisk markets where stresstested banks own no branches and prices rise mainly where they do the results suggest that banks price the stresstest induced increase in capital requirements where they have local knowledge and exit where they do not stress tests do not however reduce aggregate credit small banks seem to increase their share in geographies formerly reliant on stresstested lenders
counties more likely to be affected by climate change pay more in underwriting fees and initial yields to issue longterm municipal bonds compared to counties unlikely to be affected by climate change this difference disappears when comparing shortterm municipal bonds implying the market prices climate change risks for longterm securities only higher issuance costs for climate risk counties are driven by bonds with lower credit ratings investor attention is a driving factor as the difference in issuance costs on bonds issued by climate and nonclimate affected counties increases after the release of the stern review on climate change elsevier bv
shorting flows remain a significant predictor of negative future stock returns during when daily shortsale volume data are published in real time this predictability decays slowly and lasts for a year longterm shorting flows are more informative than shortterm shorting flows indeed abnormal shortterm shorting flows do not predict future returns or anticipate bad news we find that short sellers exploit prominent anomalies a comparison with the regulation sho data indicates that the predictability is much shorterterm during short sellers appear to have shifted from trading on shortterm private information to trading on longterm public information that is gradually incorporated into prices elsevier bv
time series momentum tsm refers to the predictability of the past month return on the next onemonth return and is the focus of several recent influential studies this paper shows that assetbyasset time series regressions reveal little evidence of tsm both in and outofsample while the tstatistic in a pooled regression appears large it is not statistically reliable as it is less than the critical values of parametric and nonparametric bootstraps from an investment perspective the tsm strategy is profitable but its performance is virtually the same as that of a similar strategy that is based on historical sample mean and does not require predictability overall the evidence on tsm is weak particularly for the large cross section of assets elsevier bv

past trends in fundamentals linked to economic activity and inflation predict currency returns we find that a trading strategy that goes long currencies with strong economic momentum and short currencies with weak economic momentum exhibits an annualized sharpe ratio of and yields a significant alpha when controlling for standard carry momentum and value strategies the economic momentum strategy subsumes the alpha of carry trades suggesting that differences in past economic trends capture crosscountry differences in carry
we propose a new pricebased measure of information risk called abnormal idiosyncratic volatility aiv that captures information asymmetry faced by uninformed investors aiv is the idiosyncratic volatility prior to information events in excess of normal levels using earnings announcements as information events we show that aiv is positively associated with informed return runups abnormal insider trading short selling and institutional trading during preearningsannouncement periods we find that stocks with high aiv earn economically and statistically larger future returns than stocks with low aiv taken together our findings support the notion that information risk is priced elsevier bv
investment banks frequently hire analysts from rating agencies while many argue that this revolving door creates captured analysts it can also create incentives to improve accuracy to study this issue i construct an original data set linking analysts to their career paths and the securitized finance ratings they issue first i show that accurate analysts are more frequently hired by underwriting investment banks second i exploit two distinct sources of variation in the likelihood of being hired by a bank both indicate that as this likelihood rises analyst accuracy improves the findings suggest policymakers should consider incentive effects alongside capture concerns elsevier bv
the us federal reserve purchased both agency mortgagebacked securities mbs and treasury securities to conduct quantitative easing using microlevel data we find that banks benefiting from mbs purchases increase mortgage origination compared with other banks at the same time these banks reduce commercial lending and firms that borrow from these banks decrease investment the effect of treasury purchases is different either positive or insignificant in most cases our results suggest that mbs purchases caused unintended real effects and that treasury purchases did not cause a large positive stimulus to the economy through the bank lending channel elsevier bv
we explore how large and small banks make funding decisions when systemwide bailouts are possible we show that bank size purely on strategic grounds is a key determinant of banks leverage choices even when bailout policies treat large and small banks symmetrically large banks leverage more than small banks because they internalize that their decisions directly affect bailout policies in equilibrium this effect is amplified by strategic spillovers to small banks since banks leverage choices are strategic complements overall the presence of large banks makes bailouts more likely the optimal regulation features sizedependent policies that disproportionately restrict large banks leverage elsevier bv
i develop an equilibrium model to explain why few mutual fund managers consistently outperform even though many have strong informational advantages the key ingredient is that managers obtain investment ideas through idea sharing idea sharing improves statistical significance of alpha through increased price informativeness but it also causes better informed managers to take larger positions which makes their alpha noisier although a significant fraction of managers builds strong informational advantages statistical significance and persistence of alpha concentrate in underperforming funds i argue that inhouse development of ideas cannot explain these facts elsevier bv
this paper documents a significantly negative crosssectional relation between lefttail risk and future returns on individual stocks trading in the us and international countries we provide a behavioral explanation to this anomaly based on the idea that investors underestimate the persistence in lefttail risk and overprice stocks with large recent losses thus low returns in the lefttail of the distribution persist into the future causing lefttail return momentum we find that the lefttail risk anomaly is stronger for stocks that are more likely to be held by retail investors that receive less investor attention and that are costlier to arbitrage elsevier bv
using unique data at transaction and identity levels we provide the first systematic study of interest rate swaps traded over the counter otc we find substantial and persistent heterogeneity in derivative prices consistent with a passthrough of regulatory costs on to market prices via socalled valuation adjustments xva a client pays a higher price to buy interest rate protection from a dealer ie the client pays a higher fixed rate if the contract is not cleared via a central counterparty this otc premium decreases by posting initial margins and with higher buyers creditworthiness otc premia are absent for dealers suggesting bargaining power the authors
this paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to quantify the effects of bank capital requirements households preferences for liquid assets imply a liquidity premium on deposits the banking sector supplies deposits and has excessive risktaking incentives i show that the scarcity of deposits created by an increased capital requirement can reduce the cost of capital for banks and increase bank lending a higher capital requirement also increases banks monitoring incentives which improves the efficiency of banks activities under reasonable parameterizations the marginal benefit of a higher capital requirement related to this channel significantly exceeds the marginal cost indicating that us capital requirements have been suboptimally low elsevier bv

we examine how local newspaper closures affect public finance outcomes for local governments following a newspaper closure municipal borrowing costs increase by basis points costing the municipality an additional per issue this effect is causal and not driven by underlying economic conditions the loss of government monitoring resulting from a closure is associated with higher government wages and deficits and increased likelihoods of costly advance refundings and negotiated sales overall our results indicate that local newspapers hold their governments accountable keeping municipal borrowing costs low and ultimately saving local taxpayers money elsevier bv
we model a dynamic economy with strategic complementarity among investors and study how endogenous government interventions mitigate coordination failures we establish equilibrium existence and uniqueness and we show that one intervention can affect another through altering the public information structure a stronger initial intervention helps subsequent interventions through increasing the likelihood of positive news but also leads to negative conditional updates our results suggest optimal policy should emphasize initial interventions when coordination outcomes tend to correlate neglecting informational externalities of initial interventions results in over or underinterventions moreover saving smaller funds disproportionally more can generate greater informational benefits at smaller costs elsevier bv
after decades of deprioritizing shareholders economic interests and low corporate profitability japan introduced the jpxnikkei in the index highlighted the countrys bestrun companies by annually selecting the most profitable of its large and liquid firms we find that managers competed for inclusion in the index by significantly increasing return on equity roe and they did so at least in part due to their reputational or status concerns the roe increase was predominantly driven by improvements in margins which were in turn partially driven by cutting research and development rd intensity our findings suggest that indexes can affect managerial behavior through reputational or status incentives elsevier bv

this paper studies the impact of the european central banks ecb corporate sector purchase programme cspp announcement on prices liquidity and debt issuance in the european corporate bond market using a data set on bond transactions from euroclear i find that the quantitative easing qe programme increased prices and liquidity of bonds eligible to be purchased substantially bond yields dropped on average by basis points bps after the cspp announcement triparty repo turnover rose by million usd and bilateral turnover went up by million usd bidask spreads also showed significant liquidity improvement in eligible bonds qe was successful in boosting corporate debt issuance firms issued billion eur more in qeeligible debt after the cspp announcement compared to other types of debt surprisingly corporates used the attracted funds mostly to increase dividends these effects were more pronounced for longermaturity lowerrated bonds and for more creditconstrained lowerrated firms elsevier bv
we provide a new methodology to empirically investigate the respective roles of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness in explaining expected stock returns using a large number of predictors we forecast the crosssectional ranks of systematic and idiosyncratic skewness which are easier to predict than their actual values compared to other measures of ex ante systematic skewness our forecasts create a significant spread in ex post systematic skewness a predicted systematic skewness risk factor carries a significant and robust risk premium that ranges from to per year in contrast the role of idiosyncratic skewness in pricing stocks is less robust elsevier bv
this paper develops an overlapping generations model of optimal rebalancing where agents differ in age and risk tolerance equilibrium rebalancing is driven by a leverage effect that influences levered and unlevered agents in opposite directions an aggregate risk tolerance effect that depends on the distribution of wealth and an intertemporal hedging effect after a negative macroeconomic shock relatively risktolerant investors sell risky assets while more riskaverse investors buy them owing to interactions of leverage and changing wealth however all agents have higher exposure to aggregate risk after a negative macroeconomic shock and lower exposure after a positive shock
we examine market making behavior of dealers for corporate bonds many of which trade infrequently dealers have a substantially higher propensity to offset trades within the same day rather than committing capital for longer periods for riskier and less actively traded bonds dealers holding periods do not decline with a bonds prior trading activity and in fact are lowest for some of the least active bonds as a result crosssectional estimates of roundtrip trading costs do not increase as prior trading activity declines our results suggest that dealers endogenously adjust their behavior to mitigate inventory risk from trading in illiquid and higher risk securities balancing search and inventory costs in equilibrium such that observed spreads can appear invariant to expected liquidity elsevier bv
we survey institutional venture capitalists vcs at firms to learn how they make decisions using the framework in kaplan and strmberg we provide detailed information on vcs practices in preinvestment screening sourcing evaluating and selecting investments in structuring investments and in postinvestment monitoring and advising in selecting investments vcs see the management team as somewhat more important than businessrelated characteristics such as product or technology although there is meaningful crosssectional variation across company stage and industry vcs also attribute the ultimate investment success or failure more to the team than to the business while deal sourcing deal selection and postinvestment valueadded all contribute to value creation the vcs rate deal selection as the most important of the three we compare our results to those for chief financial officers graham and harvey and private equity investors gompers et al a elsevier bv
although there are a number of excellent suggestions from editors on how to conduct structure and publish research in general we thought it would be useful to offer some guidance from an entrepreneurship perspective writing this paper allowed us to reflect on our work as authors reviewers and editors to offer some advice in the form of simple rules for conducting entrepreneurship research templates for structuring entrepreneurship research and heuristics for writing entrepreneurship research while not exhaustive we have focused on the rules of thumb that have served us well and we hope that others find them useful the authors
affect is increasingly studied within entrepreneurship we develop a partial mediation model in which positive and negative dispositional affect influences entry into entrepreneurship suggesting that those experiencing greater negative affect experience less job satisfaction and are more likely to enter entrepreneurship using a novel methodological approach to capture affective disposition we test our model on a large panel dataset from australia finding support for our hypotheses these findings provide a muchneeded counterbalance to the prevailing focus in entrepreneurship on the positive consequences of positive affect and introduce affect into the study of the fundamental question of why some people but not others become entrepreneurs in the first place the authors
drawing on the transgenerational entrepreneurship perspective we employ a multiple case study approach to investigate why multigenerational family firms innovate the data collection process drew upon five indepth cases comprising semistructured interviews participant observations and several thousand pages of historical data dating from to we find patterns on how the firms longterm view embracing both the past and the future influences the innovation motives of these firms specifically we identify three innovation patterns conserving persisting and legacybuilding we introduce a set of propositions and a framework linking longterm orientation dimensions to innovation motives and innovation outcomes our research thus contributes to a more finegrained understanding of innovation behavior in family firms the authors
despite mounting interest in growth mindset interventions this approach has yet to be applied to the domain of entrepreneurship in the present research we developed and tested if a growth mindset intervention could be leveraged to promote students entrepreneurial selfefficacy and if this in turn predicted career development ie academic interest career interest task persistence and academic performance we report on our findings from an open science framework osf preregistered study that is a randomized controlled trial implementing a growth mindset intervention we randomly assigned undergraduate students n in an introduction to entrepreneurship class to either the growth mindset intervention or to a knowledgebased attentionmatched control students in the growth mindset intervention relative to the control reported greater entrepreneurial selfefficacy and task persistence on their main class project the intervention also indirectly improved academic and career interest via entrepreneurial selfefficacy however the intervention failed to directly or indirectly impact performance on a classroom assignment additionally and somewhat surprisingly gender and past experience in the field failed to moderate any effects of the intervention on outcomes theoretical implications limitations and future directions are discussed the authors
this article explains how collective environmental entrepreneurship can ensure the sustainable exploitation of opportunities based on natural resources we discuss the major threats entrepreneurial ventures face in pursuing potential naturebased opportunities and the collective action they take to preserve the associated natural resources while also providing access to them this analysis adds to our understanding of environmental entrepreneurship by detailing the possible problems associated with exploiting potential naturebased opportunities the ways ventures can come together to collectively address these exploitation challenges and the benefits of such collective action for both ventures and nature the authors
we extend the resource dependence theory to argue for the opposing effects of political relationship building on new ventures abilities to obtain suppliers and buyers by signaling endorsement and better access to resources political connection enhances new ventures legitimacy and bargaining position in supply chains featuring high contractual uncertainties suppliers favor new ventures with higher certainty of payment but buyers can be deterred by new ventures more difficult to control hence paradoxically political relationship building can exert opposing effects on a new ventures acquisition of suppliers and buyers we found empirical support through a survey of new ventures in china the authors
this study develops and tests a theory about the antecedents of venture capital firms vcs attention breadth to their portfolio companies pfcs we find that vcs expand their attention breadth but only up to a certain level of expected investment horizons for each pfc after which attention breadth narrows we also find that this inverted ushaped relationship is contingent upon the vc investment horizon dispersion and the number of coinvestors in a given pfc our research advances the entrepreneurship and venture capital literature and provides novel insight into the broader literature on investment horizons and strategic alliances the authors
how can problems be turned into something good we develop and test a theoretical model suggesting that error mastery orientation influences whether problems have positive or negative outcomes we argue that problems increase or decrease entrepreneurial learning and venture progress depending on error mastery orientation we tested our theoretical model using a longitudinal design with one baseline measurement and weekly measurements analyses were based on lagged observations from individuals who engaged in venture creation as part of entrepreneurship training courses the results suggest that error mastery orientation functions like a switch turning problems into something good the authors
longestablished family firms are endowed with a bundle of beliefs and practices that constitute their tradition however to remain competitive they need to renew their products and production processes such forces pulling toward the past and the future antithetically calling for continuity and change seem paradoxical in an abductive analysis of eight longestablished family firms in turkey we identify four equifinal strategies to manage this paradox adopting a family imprinting perspective we theorize how the longlasting legacy of previous family generations shapes different approaches to innovation and tradition depending on the content imprinted on the current family generation contributing to family business imprinting and innovation research we identify the new construct of temporal symbiosis as a firms simultaneous adoption of retrospective and prospective approaches to using its resources to concurrently perpetuate tradition and achieve innovation highlighting its crucial role as a shield of the past and engine for the future the authors
we contribute to the organizational aspirations and corporate venturing literature by theorizing and testing a the influence of a firms idiosyncratic strategic posture on behavioral responses to performance attainment discrepancies and b that performance feedback may influence multifaceted yet thematically related forms of search specifically we examine the influence of performance feedback on equitybased external corporate venturing we then propose that a firms entrepreneurial orientation eo is a critical contingency when theorizing about how firms respond to attainment discrepancies our findings indicate that a firms eo is an important contingency when considering behavioral responses to attainment discrepancies the authors
the notion of effectual networks is one of the central concepts in the effectuation research however there has been little conceptual and empirical work on how they emerge and what structures they have this article incorporates the concept of complex adaptive systems from complexity theory to understand both their dynamic and structural elements we examine the effectual networks and networking of startups from finland and offer a processsystem model of effectual networks we derive propositions that connect dynamic and structural entrepreneurrelated factors of their emergence and outline directions for future research at the intersection of effectuation and complexity theory the authors
wellbeing is an essential outcome of engagement in entrepreneurship but the pathway from selfemployment to wellbeing is poorly understood to address this we develop a model in which psychological functioning purposeful engagement with life realization of personal talents and capabilities and fulfillment of intrinsic needs such as autonomy and competence mediates the relationship between entrepreneurship and subjective wellbeing we test our model with data from the european social survey using structural equation modeling and a series of robustness tests eg propensity score matching estimators and accounting for model uncertainty results suggest that entrepreneurship is associated with substantial benefits in terms of psychological functioning both personal and social which almost entirely mediate the relationship between entrepreneurship and subjective wellbeing these findings highlight psychological functioning as a critical pathway between entrepreneurship and subjective wellbeing the authors

while scholars frequently argue that nascent entrepreneurs will be more successful if they are resilient this assumption remains untested and the mechanisms for its potential benefits are unknown to establish the utility of this psychological construct we draw from fredricksons broadenandbuild theory to develop and test theory on the processes through which psychological resilience influences firsttime entrepreneurs business survival results of a timelagged study of nascent entrepreneurs followed over a year period support this theory highlighting the cognitive and behavioral ways in which psychological resilience helps nascent entrepreneurs become less vulnerable to their stressful circumstances the authors
we test the inefficient riskbearing hypothesis that thirdparty loan guarantors bear a higher risk on loans to franchisees than on loans to independent businesses by assessing whether franchisees default more than independent businesses on thirdparty guarantee loans in a sample of sba a loans disbursed between and franchisee loans compared to independent business loans with a higher percentage of the loan guarantee or made to years before a recession have a higher likelihood of default the findings imply a distinctive loan default risk profile for franchisee loans the authors
building new space for institutional theory we propose how the severity of formal and informal institutional voids shapes the productivity of entrepreneurial activities within society our theory makes the key assumptions that voids can exist in both formal and informal institutions and that they are capable of hindering entrepreneurial behavior that is favorable to development progress we extend new theoretical domains by conceptualizing informal institutional voids and proposing how both formal and informal institutional voids and their interaction influence two qualitative outcomes within localities the unique forms of entrepreneurial activity and the objectives underlying this entrepreneurial activity the authors
this article analyzes the contagion process of entrepreneurial passion and its effects on employee outcomes we develop a mediation model showing entrepreneurs entrepreneurial passion affects an employee passion response which in turn affects employee outcomes we draw on a dualprocess perspective to analyze how entrepreneurs emotional and identity displays interact to create employees perceptions of entrepreneurs passion and question whether the contagion effect uniformly works for all employees our empirical studies one field study and one experiment provide empirical support for a contagion effect of entrepreneurial passion and show the particularities of the effects of entrepreneurs passion on employee outcomes the authors
social entrepreneurs increasingly use franchising to scale social value tracey and jarvis described how social franchising is like commerciallyoriented franchising but noted critical challenges arising from dual goals we investigate a social franchisor that overcame these challenges and describe how the social mission became the source of business model innovation we show that the social mission fostered a shared identity that guided the search for adaptations to the franchise model the shared missiondriven identity created pressure toward decentralized decisionmaking shared governance and a role for the franchisor as orchestrator of collaborative knowledge sharing among franchisees findings should help social franchisors avoid common pitfalls and suggest future research questions for social entrepreneurship and franchising scholars the authors
given variance in entrepreneurs capital endowments the question of sufficient or insufficient starting conditions enabling a pathway to survival is critical in entrepreneurship drawing on the subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship ste we adopt a configurational approach our results show how combinations of human and social capital are related to survival while overreliance on financial capital is not from a subjectivist perspective we reveal a potential gap between identifying and exploiting an opportunity the findings provide some novel insights that help reframe conflicting results as to whether capital endowments are substitutes or complements the authors
we examine the effects of family control on entry mode choice by integrating transaction costs economics with the family business literature using a dataset of foreign investments we investigate the role of family involvement on entry modes after controlling for endogeneity we find that if both the investing and the local firm are family firms forming a joint venture is preferred while if only the investing firm is a family firm a wholly owned subsidiary is more likely results show that family control has an important impact on entry modes an hypothesis that has not yet been fully explored the authors
considerable evidence suggests that ceos often behave myopically it is open to debate however whether managerial myopia is equally prevalent among founderled firms drawing on agency theory and stewardship theory we analyze whether founderled firms are less likely than nonfounderled firms to cut rd expenditures in order to meet the shortterm earnings goals suggested by these firms past performance histories our analysis of standard poors companies from to indicates that myopia is an enduring phenomenon and prevalent among very large companies however founderled firms are less likely than nonfounderled firms to exhibit myopic behavior the authors
we examine the effect of combining internal and external rd loci on innovation performance in family firms ff and nonfamily firms nonffs our longitudinal analysis of firmyear observations of spanish manufacturing firms from to shows that ffs can better exploit the benefits of simultaneously engaging in internal and external rd activities leading to a positive effect on innovation performance moreover the relationship between combined internal and external rd and innovation performance in ffs is contingent upon firm economic performance by pointing to the importance of taking into account the combination of internal and external rd loci to foster innovation in ffs we challenge current family business innovation research the authors

we follow one advisor and five family firm succession cases over years to capture emerging emotions during the succession process using inductive analysis we investigate how the advisors mediation of these emotions affects individuallevel satisfaction with the succession process interviews observation meeting minutes and archival data reveal an iterative process the advisor first unearths the incumbents and successors emotions to surface emotional tensions before alleviating them unearthing and alleviating emotions speeds role adjustments and advances succession especially when the incumbent becomes stuck in the process emotion mediation and role adjustment appear to foster individuallevel satisfaction with the succession process the authors
we study initial entrepreneurial networking and describe it as a process of initiating reacting and evaluating networking our study of student entrepreneurs weekly diaries particularly points at the interaction of networking actions and cognitive evaluations we introduce the concept of network momentum which refers to the entrepreneurs perception that the network starts to exist without the immediate effort of the entrepreneur and we analyze the processes that lead to the establishment of network momentum our study contributes to the emergent literature on entrepreneurial networking and the role of cognitive evaluative processes in particular the authors
regions with spatial concentrations of businesses create conditions that spawn new firms but also undercut new venture survival localized competition puts pressure on new firms to exit adding to this pressure to exit is regional path dependence which limits the ability of firms to respond strategically to hostile local conditions we investigate the extent to which the pressure to exit created by localized competition is moderated by three path breaking factors new knowledge industry diversity and industry switching we test and find broad support for our hypotheses using data from metropolitan statistical areas in the united states spanning to the authors
we examine how the prior experiences of new venture leaders nvls affect networking behaviors during the early stages of opportunity exploitation we argue that lack of prior experience increases the unknowns that nvls face when pursuing opportunity exploitation lack of technical experience increases technical unknowns whereas lack of startup experience increases startup unknowns using a qualitative methodology we investigate nvls and find that they differ on three dimensions networking time orientation shortterm vs longterm desired benefits operational vs symbolic and networking actions deepening vs broadening we find that novice nvls those who lack technical or startup experience tend to utilize shortterm orientation engage in networkdeepening actions and seek operational benefits from their networks to mitigate technical and startup unknowns in contrast dualexperienced nvls those with technical and startup experience are guided by longterm orientations networkbroadening actions and a focus on symbolic benefits we also find that technical and startup veterans exhibit a combination of those behaviors we contribute to the literature by posing a set of three propositions depicting differences in nvl networking behaviors based on differences in startup andor technical experiences this study thus highlights the influence of nvl experience on earlystage networks the authors
entrepreneurship for sustainable development is a multilevel phenomenon connecting social environmental and economic dimensions between entrepreneurial processes market transformations as well as largescale societal developments while previous articles on social environmental and sustainable entrepreneurship have advanced our understanding on processes of discovery creation and exploitation of sustainabilityoriented opportunities the links between contextual influences on venture development and transformational outcomes at multiple levels are only partially captured in extant frameworks drawing out causal mechanisms with a systematic review this article proposes a multilevel framework for linking mechanisms in existing literature and proposing future research on entrepreneurship for sustainable development the authors
does the presence of multiple and unrelated family controllers improve firm performance drawing on both agency and behavioral agency theories we argue that multifamily firms outperform singlefamily firms since families in multifamily firms actively monitor owners socioemotional goals additionally we suggest that a balanced distribution of control among the owning families facilitates the monitoring process finally we argue that the focal relationship follows an inverted ushaped pattern depending on the number of families controlling the firm we test our hypotheses using a sample of chilean publicly listed family firms our study extends current knowledge of the uniqueness of multifamily firms the authors
we combine insights from behavioral and skill perspectives on network agency to address how entrepreneurs networking with close social ties and weak ties influences business launch and the extent to which social skills strengthened or weakened these influences combining network perspectives previously developed in parallel we fill in the gap of how well entrepreneurs are networking we find frequent networking with close social ties increases entrepreneurs chances of business launch when they have high social skills but decreases their chances when they have low social skills while networking with weak ties increases chances of business launch regardless of social skills the authors

research on entrepreneurial organizations has grown rapidly over recent decades however prior research has developed different ways to conceptualize entrepreneurial organizations resulting in an ongoing discussion and a highly complex body of research thus hindering the evolution of the literature to improve our understanding of the structure and content of the field we provide a synthesis of these conceptualizations and how they are reflected in the literature through a bibliometric analysis our findings uncover research topics and theoretical foundations of the field and how certain conversations pursue them through different conceptualizations building on our results we identify future research opportunities the authors
this article theorizes how shortterm revenue volatility affects new venture viability and how such volatility develops over time tracking the bank accounts of new ventures over a year period we find that even after controlling for a range of other factors shortterm revenue volatility is a strong predictor of venture exit although shortterm revenue volatility is associated with the depletion of buffer resources and financial default surviving ventures do not on average decrease their shortterm revenue volatility over time however shortterm revenue volatility decreases at the cohort level due to higher exit rates of volatile ventures the authors
this study examines family firms propensity to protect their intellectual property through patents building on the mixed gamble logic of the behavioral agency model we theorize that family ownership has a ushaped relationship with firm propensity to patent specifically we argue that family firms desire to prevent losses of current socioemotional wealth sew inhibits their propensity to patent until a threshold level of family ownership beyond which the familys sew is secured and a greater focus on prospective financial gains attainable through patents is possible we also suggest that environmental munificence moderates this nonlinear relationship such that a lowmunificent environment accentuates the potentially detrimental beneficial effects of lowtomedium mediumtohigh levels of family ownership on patents we test our hypotheses on a sample of small and mediumsized family firms the authors
policymakers increasingly demand private enterprises to help solve social and ecological challenges faced by nations worldwide in this article we use toulmins rhetoric model to explain how european union policy rhetoric articulates the meaning of entrepreneurship for sustainable development our findings demonstrate a rhetoric mix of argumentations through which policy rhetoric conveys three meanings of entrepreneurship beneficiary in corrective sustainability contributor in constructive sustainability and opportunistic operator in assertive sustainability and imposes shared beliefs that frame the policy discourse in conclusion we introduce a framework of rhetoric mix to advance research on entrepreneurship policy discourse and sustainable entrepreneurship the authors
calling upon stakeholder theory and the socioemotional wealth sew literature we investigate how sew impacts the declinestemming strategies of family firms drawing on a recent conceptualization of sew we validate a twodimensional measurement of the construct using a content analysis technique our empirical test on a sample of publicly traded family firms in need of turnaround suggests that the strategic preferences of family firms change depending upon the type of sew extended vs restricted the owning family values the most the finegrained characterization of sew adopted in this study accounts for withinfamilyfirm differences and thus enables the reconciliation of conflicting findings in the literature the authors
the heterogeneity of family firms and their simultaneous pursuit of financial and nonfinancial goals is well established in the literature however causal factors underlying the variance in the goals behaviors and performance of family firms remain unclear to help fill this gap the articles in this special issue point to psychological aspects of individuals and families that underpin family firm behaviors and outcomes building on the theme of psychological influences this introductory article discusses how the integration of five areas of psychology can accelerate our understanding of the causes and consequences of individual and group behaviors in family firms the authors
despite the assumption that symptoms of hypomania are detrimental they may prove beneficial within selfemployment contexts drawing on personenvironment pe fit theory and using the first national epidemiologic survey on alcohol related conditions nesarc our conservative inferences are that for selfemployed individuals hypomania has a positive association with income selfemployed individuals with higher education have higher levels of income with increasing hypomania score and older selfemployed individuals with a higher hypomania score have a higher income these findings have implications for the literature on hypomania symptoms and selfemployment related labor market outcomes the authors
we examine the effect of private accounting information becoming public on small firms access to bank debt both proprietary cost of disclosure and relationship banking have contributed to german private firms traditional nondisclosure of financial statements we employ a regulatory change which increased enforcement and established severe fines for firms that do not publicly disclose financial statements as a quasinatural experiment we find that small firms access to bank debt has significantly increased after the disclosure shock with our study based on a novel dataset in a nonvoluntary private firm setting we contribute to the discussion on private and public information in debt contracting the authors
political connection in china is often tested for correlation with business success and government support under a suspicion that connected entrepreneurs enjoy special favors and protection research evidence is mixed in revisiting the debate on political capital in china we apply a socially embedded perspective on political connection to this end we introduce two methodological innovations a we develop a broader measure of political connectedness that covers the continuum from political connection to disconnection b we integrate data on political connection with social network data specifically we explore how the social structure around the individual entrepreneur affects performance above and beyond the often tested association between political ties and performance we draw two conclusions the success association with political connection is discontinuous advantage is less for entrepreneurs weakly connected politically but significant additional disadvantage arises for the politically disconnected the additional is that entrepreneurs disconnected from government show no benefit from having an advantaged business network the politically connected with an advantaged business network show more prosperous business higher returns on assets and more likely survival over time the politically disconnected show none of these benefits we caution the entrepreneur who plans to ignore the government the authors
while previous studies focus on differences between family and nonfamily firms regarding ceo selection and executive compensation this study investigates differences among family firms with different types of kinship ties we find that compared with family firms with close kinship ties those with distant kinship ties are more likely to appoint a nonfamily ceo and to pay nonfamily executives lower salaries this relationship is moderated by firm performance and family ownership based on evolutionary psychology we propose that family firms with close versus distant kinships have different motivation levels to preserve socioemotional wealth the authors
we discuss family firm longevity building upon a new conceptual lens informed by transaction cost economics tce but augmented with corporate diplomacy thinking family firms because of their superior foundation of bonding social capital interpreted here as a firmspecific transaction costreducing governance mechanism have an intrinsic advantage visvis nonfamily firms with regards to utilizing network ties supportive of longevity most family firms however fail to leverage effectively this governance tool to achieve longevity due to bifurcation bias bb that is the unchecked prioritization of assets and relationships that hold affective value for the family we propose that corporate diplomacy through its three process steps familiarization acceptance and engagement can help the family firm augment its baseline reservoir of social capital and allows improved economizing on contracting challenges that endanger its survival externally corporate diplomacy helps economizing on expressions of bb in relationships with outside stakeholders thus augmenting bridging social capital internally it can address biased treatment of family versus nonfamily human assets thereby augmenting bonding social capital intergenerationally corporate diplomacy supports access to and improved reliance upon the firms social capital by next generation family members the family firms that focus on corporate diplomacy processes and the resulting social capital creation greatly improve their chances of longevity the authors
we posit that environmental hostility exhibits an inverse ushaped relationship with a firms entrepreneurial orientation we suggest a nuanced perspective on the threat rigidity argument that firms generally retrench from entrepreneurial capital allocation behaviors as hostility increases we argue that firms are likely to act opportunistically and increase eo but only to the point where the marginal costs of such activity outweigh the marginal benefits at which point eo drops precipitously analyzing observations from firms across industries from through our results indicate that eo exhibits a generally negative relationship with environmental hostility further we examine a potential moderating influence of recoverable slack on the hostilityeo relationship arguing that recoverable slack represents a meaningful buffer on behavioral change stemming from changing environmental hostility the authors
we study how the italian sovereign bond scarcity premia specialness in the repo market were affected by the european central bank ecbs purchases during the euro area sovereign debt crisis we propose and calibrate a searchbased dynamic model with a central bank acting as a buyandhold investor consistent with model predictions ecb purchases drive specialness of targeted securities in combination with shortselling special benchmark bonds entail a positive cash premium but their market liquidity decreases when purchased by the ecb shortsellers were more likely to failtodeliver very special bonds while holders of these bonds were less inclined to pledge them as collateral to the ecb liquidity operations
we investigate the dynamics of heterogeneous beliefs and link them to the volatility pattern throughout the seasoned equity offering seo event window in sync with a reduction in information asymmetry related to management information releases around the seo event belief heterogeneity declines moreover heterogeneity in beliefs proxied by either analyst or institutionaltradebased measures is a robust and salient determinant of seo firm volatility which provides an explanation for the volatility timing puzzle identified in the seo market furthermore the relation between heterogeneous beliefs and return volatility weakens as short sale constraints tighten suggesting a potential causal link
during the financial crisis the federal reserve established two emergency facilities for brokerdealers one provided collateralized loans the other collateral upgrades these facilities alleviated dealers funding pressures when access to repos backed by illiquid collateral deteriorated the ability to upgrade collateral allowed dealers to continue funding their own illiquid inventories avoiding potential firesales and to provide better bond market liquidity it also helped sustain dealers credit to hedge fund clients which in turn posted relatively better returns
households hold undiversified stock portfolios of firms headquartered near their city of residence leading explanations assign a causal role for proximity the literature neglects that distance is endogenous households may locate based on unobservables such as optimism about a citys economic prospects which can be correlated with latent localstock demand we use locationchoice models to account for this selection we propose as instruments that older households prefer to locate in recreational areas for nonpecuniary reasons our analysis based on a widely used household data set yields significantly smaller estimates for proximity in determining portfolio choice compared to those in the literature elsevier bv
to understand the link between financial intermediation activities and the real economy we build a general equilibrium model in which agency frictions in the financial sector affect the efficiency of capital reallocation across firms and generate aggregate economic fluctuations we develop a recursive policy iteration approach to fully characterize the nonlinear equilibrium dynamics and the offsteadystate crisis behavior in our model adverse shocks to agency frictions exacerbate capital misallocation and manifest themselves as variations in total factor productivity at the aggregate level our model endogenously generates countercyclical volatility in the aggregate time series and countercyclical dispersion in the marginal product of capital and asset returns in the crosssection elsevier bv
using data on white house visitors from through we find that corporate executives meetings with key policymakers are associated with positive abnormal stock returns we also find evidence suggesting that firms receive more government contracts and are more likely to receive regulatory relief as measured by the tone of regulatory news following meetings with federal government officials using the presidential election as a shock to political access we find that firms with access to the obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms overall our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations elsevier bv
we build a dynamic agency model in which the agent controls both current earnings via shortterm investment and firm growth via longterm investment under the optimal contract agency conflicts can induce short and longterm investment levels beyond first best leading to short or longtermism in corporate policies the paper analytically shows how firm characteristics shape the optimal contract and the horizon of corporate policies thereby generating a number of novel empirical predictions on the optimality of short versus longtermism it also demonstrates that combining short and longterm agency conflicts naturally leads to asymmetric payforperformance in managerial contracts
we estimate institutional investor preferences from proxy voting records the wnominate method maps investors onto a leftright dimension based on votes for fiscal year public pension funds and other investors on the left support a more social and environmentfriendly orientation of the firm and fewer executive compensation proposals moneyconscious investors appear on the right the proxy advisor iss makes voting recommendations that place it center to the left of most large mutual funds a second dimension reflects a more traditional governance view with managementdisciplinarian investors the proxy advisor glass lewis among them pitted against more managementfriendly ones
the existing literature has shown that an increase in the demand for safe assets induces the private sector to create more of them focusing on repos backed by us treasuries i theoretically and empirically show that an increase in the demand for safe assets leads to a decrease in repos outstanding because treasuries are safe assets an increase in the demand for safe assets compresses their term premia reducing incentives to issue repos thus the sensitivity of private safe asset creation depends on whether the collateral backing them are safe assets themselves the sensitivity of the federal reserves reverse repurchase agreement rrp operations has the same sign as existing studies
we develop a novel method to dynamically hedge foreign exchange exposure in international equity and bond portfolios the method exploits the timeseries predictability of currency returns which we show emerges from exploiting a forecastable component in global factor returns the hedging strategy outperforms leading alternative approaches to currency hedging across a large set of performance metrics moreover we find that exploiting currency return predictability via an independent currency portfolio delivers a high riskadjusted return and provides superior diversification gains to global equity and bond investors relative to currency carry value and momentum investment strategies elsevier bv
the likelihood of seasoned equity offerings seos jumps discontinuously when the stock price equals the most recent equity offer price anchoring on the last offer price holds after considering executive turnovers stock splits earnings management or dividend adjustments using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around this cutoff which exploits local randomness in stock prices we investigate the consequences of anchoring in seos we find significant increases in cash holdings and acquisitions of lower quality with no real effects on investment or employment overall we provide some of the cleanest estimates to date of the timing and causal effects of seos elsevier ltd
the promise of contingent convertible capital securities cocos as a bailin solution has been the subject of considerable theoretical analysis and debate but little is known about their effects in practice we undertake the first comprehensive empirical analysis of bank coco issues a market segment that comprises over instruments totaling billion four main findings emerge the propensity to issue a coco is higher for larger and better capitalized banks coco issues result in a statistically significant decline in issuers cds spread indicating that they generate riskreduction benefits and lower costs of debt this is especially true for cocos that convert into equity have mechanical triggers and are classified as additional tier instruments cocos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on cds spreads and coco issues have no statistically significant impact on stock prices except for principal writedown cocos with a high trigger level which have a positive effect elsevier bv
the price of discount rate risk reveals whether increases in equity risk premia represent good or bad news to rational investors employing a new empirical methodology we find that the price is negative which suggests that discount rates are high during times of high marginal utility of wealth our approach relies on using future realized market returns to consistently estimate covariances of asset returns with the market risk premium covariances drive observed patterns in a broad cross section of stock and bond expected returns elsevier bv
we develop a parsimonious model to study the effect of regulations aimed at reducing counterparty risk on the structure of overthecounter securities markets we find that such regulations promote entry of dealers thus fostering competition and lowering spreads greater competition however has an indirect negative effect on marketmaking profitability general equilibrium effects imply that more competition can distort incentives of all dealers to invest in efficient technologies ex ante and so can cause a social welfare loss our results are consistent with empirical findings on the effects of postcrisis regulations and with the opposition of some market participants to those regulations elsevier bv
this paper examines the joint determination of deviations in longterm covered interest rate parity and differences in the credit spread of bonds of similar risk but different currency denomination these two pricing anomalies are highly aligned in both the time series and the crosssection of currencies the sum of these two pricing deviations the corporate basis represents the currencyhedged borrowing cost difference between currency regions and explains up to a third of the variation in the aggregate corporate debt issuance flow i show that arbitrage aimed at exploiting one type of security anomaly can give rise to the other
do stock prices of publicly listed companies respond to changes in transaction costs using the secs pilot program that increased the tick size for approximately randomly chosen stocks we find a stock price decrease between and for small spread stocks affected by the larger tick size relative to a control group we find that the increase in the present value of transaction costs accounts for a small percentage of the price decrease we study channels of price variation due to changes in expected returns information risk investor horizon and liquidity risk the evidence suggests that trading frictions affect the cost of capital the authors
i present a model in which bank net worth determines both loan market competition and monetary transmission to firm borrowing rates in the model banks are local monopolists for borrowers near them when they are flush with equity banks expand their lending compete for customers at the edges of their markets and pass through changes in the monetary policy rate to their loan rates when they lose substantial equity banks consolidate retreat from rivalry and frustrate monetary transmission the model explains why interest rate passthrough weakens after financial crises its predictions are consistent with several facts about banktofirm lending elsevier bv
is there a gap between the profitability of a trading strategy on paper and that which is achieved in practice we answer this question by developing a general technique to measure the realworld implementation costs of financial market anomalies our method extends famamacbeth regressions to compare the onpaper returns to factor exposures with those achieved by mutual funds unlike existing approaches ours delivers estimates of allin implementation costs without relying on parametric microstructure models or explicitly specified factor trading strategies after accounting for implementation costs typical mutual funds earn low returns to value and no returns to momentum
corporate bond mutual funds engage in liquidity transformation raising concerns among academics and policy makers that large redemptions will lead to asset fire sales we find little evidence however that bond fund redemptions drive fire sale price pressure after controlling for timevarying issuerlevel information that could also affect funds trading decisions using a novel identification strategy that exploits sameissuer bonds held by funds with differing outflows we attribute our findings which contrast with those found for equity funds to funds liquidity management strategies bond funds maintain significant liquidity cushions and selectively trade liquid assets allowing them to absorb investor redemption risk without excessively liquidating corporate bonds even during the financial crisis elsevier bv
in the us department of labor imposed new disclosure requirements for indirect fees that k retirement plan service providers earn through revenue sharing agreements with mutual funds this paper examines the impact of these fee disclosure requirements on the level and structure of fees paid by retirement plans as well as service providers ability to price discriminate between plan sponsors of different sophistication we document that the new disclosure requirements are associated with a substitution of direct fees for indirect fees and a reduction in total fees paid by smaller plans and that mutual fund providers responded by introducing retirement fund share classes with lower b fees
starting with the fundamental relation that state prices are the product of physical probabilities and the stochastic discount factor ross shows that given strong assumptions knowing state prices suffices to back out physical probabilities and the stochastic discount factor at the same time we find that such recovered physical distributions based on the sp index are incompatible with future returns and fail to predict future returns and realized variances these negative results are even stronger when we add economically reasonable constraints simple benchmark methods based on a power utility agent or the historical return distribution cannot be rejected elsevier bv
how and to what extent do managerial control benefits shape the efficiency of the takeover market we revisit this question by estimating both the dark and bright sides of managerial control benefits in an industry equilibrium model on the dark side managers private benefits of control distort firms takeover incentives and hinder the reallocation role of the takeover market on the bright side fear of a takeover induces underperforming managers to exert more effort and enhances the disciplinary role of the takeover market our estimates suggest that the brightside effect increases the value created by an active takeover market by comparable in magnitude to the darkside effect it is also important to account for this brightside effect in explaining certain features of the takeover market including a low takeoverperformance sensitivity
a central challenge in the regulation of controlled firms is curbing rent extraction by controllers as independent directors and fiduciary duties are often insufficient some jurisdictions give minority shareholders veto rights over relatedparty transactions to assess these rights effectiveness we exploit a israeli reform that gave minority shareholders veto rights over relatedparty transactions including the pay of controllers and their relatives controller executives we find that the reform curbed controllerexecutive pay and led some controller executives to resign or go with little or no pay in circumstances suggesting their pay would be rejected these findings suggest that minority veto rights can be an effective corporate governance tool
an important milestone often reached in the life of an activist engagement is entering into a settlement agreement between the activist and the targets board using a comprehensive handcollected data set we analyze the drivers nature and consequences of such settlement agreements settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents reputation concerns are stronger consistent with incomplete contracting facesaving benefits and private information considerations settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists including ceo turnover higher shareholder payouts and improved operating performance we find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors our analysis provides a look into the black box of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies elsevier bv
applying standard portfoliosort techniques to bank asset returns for countries from to we uncover a risk premium associated with implicit government guarantees this risk premium is intimately tied to sovereign risk suggesting that guaranteed banks defined as those of particular importance to the national economy inherit the risk of the guarantor indeed this premium does not exist in safehaven countries we rationalize these findings with a model in which implicit government guarantees are risky in the sense that they provide protection that depends on the aggregate state of the economy elsevier bv
identifying firm connections by shared analyst coverage we find that a connectedfirm cf momentum factor generates a monthly alpha of t in spanning regressions the alphas of industry geographic customer customersupplier industry single to multisegment and technology momentum factors are insignificantnegative after controlling for cf momentum similar results hold in crosssectional regressions and in developed international markets sellside analysts incorporate news about linked firms sluggishly these effects are stronger for complex and indirect linkages consistent with limited investor attention these results indicate that momentum spillover effects are a unified phenomenon that is captured by shared analyst coverage
using a comprehensive set of equity strategies we analyze the value of volatilitymanaged portfolios for realtime investors volatilitymanaged portfolios do not systematically outperform their corresponding unmanaged portfolios in direct comparisons consistent with moreira and muir volatilitymanaged portfolios tend to exhibit significantly positive alphas in spanning regressions however the trading strategies implied by these regressions are not implementable in real time and reasonable outofsample versions generally earn lower certainty equivalent returns and sharpe ratios than do simple investments in the original unmanaged portfolios this poor outofsample performance for volatilitymanaged portfolios stems primarily from structural instability in the underlying spanning regressions elsevier bv
after initial investments relationship financiers routinely observe interim information about projects before continuing financing them meanwhile entrepreneurs produce information endogenously and issue securities to incumbent insider and competitive outsider investors in such persuasion games with differentially informed receivers and contingent transfers entrepreneurs endogenous experimentation reduces insiders information monopoly but impedes relationship formation through an information production holdup insiders information production and interim competition mitigate this holdup and jointly explain empirical links between competition and relationship lending optimal contracts restore firstbest outcomes using convertible securities for insiders and residuals for outsiders our findings are robust under various extensions and alternative specifications elsevier bv

hedge fund activists target firms engaging in empire building and improve their future acquisition and divestiture strategy following intervention activist targets make fewer acquisitions but obtain substantially higher returns by avoiding large and diversifying deals and refraining from acquisitions during merger waves activist targets also increase the pace of divestitures and achieve higher divestiture returns than matched nontargets activists curtail empire building through the removal of empire building chief executive officers ceos compensation based incentives and appointment of new board members our findings highlight an important channel through which activists improve efficiency and create shareholder value
we investigate the effect of crossborder regulatory cooperation in the enforcement of securities laws on globalmutualfund portfolio allocations our research design exploits a shock to the securities and exchange commissions oversight of foreign firms crosslisted on a us stock exchange around the signing of the multilateral memorandum of understanding mmou a nonbinding informationsharing arrangement between global securities regulators in signatory countries foreign investment in uscrosslisted firms increases by billion relative to noncrosslisted firms the strongest effects are for investors facing greater information asymmetries those from countries closely linked to the us and nonus foreign investors suggesting significant spillover effects from international regulatory cooperation
we develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of other creditors we find that paradoxically borrowers rely most on collateral when pledgeability is high this is when taking on new debt is easy which dilutes existing creditors creditors thus require collateral for protection against possible dilution by collateralized debt there is a collateral rat race but collateralized borrowing has a cost it encumbers assets constraining future borrowing and investment there is a collateral overhang our results suggest that policies aimed at increasing the supply of collateral can backfire triggering an inefficient collateral rat race likewise upholding the absolute priority of secured debt can exacerbate the rat race
we find that corporate loan contracts frequently concentrate control rights with a subset of lenders despite the rise in term loans without financial covenants socalled covenantlite loans borrowing firms revolving lines of credit almost always retain traditional financial covenants this split structure gives revolving lenders the exclusive right and ability to monitor and to renegotiate the financial covenants and we confirm that loans with split control rights are still subject to the discipline of financial covenants we provide evidence that split control rights are designed to mitigate bargaining frictions that have arisen with the entry of nonbank lenders and became apparent during the financial crisis elsevier bv
we explore the labor market effects of gender and race by examining board leadership appointments prior studies are often limited by observing only hired candidates whereas the boardroom provides a controlled setting where both hired and unhired candidates are observable although diverse female and minority board representation has increased diverse directors are significantly less likely to serve in leadership positions despite possessing stronger qualifications than nondiverse directors while specialized skills such as prior leadership or finance experience increase the likelihood of appointment that likelihood is reduced for diverse directors additional tests provide no evidence that diverse directors are less effective
investor preferences for holding speculative assets are likely to be more pronounced ahead of firms earnings announcements probably because of lower inventory costs and immediate payoffs or because of enhanced investor attention we show that the demand for lotterylike stocks is stronger ahead of earnings announcements leading to a price runup for these stocks in sharp contrast to the standard underperformance of lotterylike stocks lotterylike stocks outperform nonlottery stocks by about basis points in the day window ahead of earnings announcements however this return spread is reversed by basis points in the day window after the announcements moreover this invertedvshaped pattern on cumulative return spreads is more pronounced among firms with a greater retail order imbalance among firms with low institutional ownership and in regions with a stronger gambling propensity and it is also robust after controlling for past month returns and various proxies for investor attention
we examine the value and efficiency of analyst recommendations through the lens of capital market anomalies we find that analysts do not fully use the information in anomaly signals when making recommendations analysts tend to give more favorable consensus recommendations to stocks classified as overvalued and more important these stocks subsequently tend to have particularly negative abnormal returns analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with anomaly signals are more skilled and elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns our findings suggest that analysts biased recommendations could be a source of market friction that impedes the efficient correction of mispricing
yes we show that dividend changes contain information about highly persistent changes in future economic income three methodological differences lead us to different conclusions from the extant literature i we use an event window approach to cleanly delineate earnings after dividend changes from those before ii we use alternative earnings measures to control for endogenous investment and asset writedowns surrounding dividend changes and iii we control for the nonlinear relation between dividend changes and market reactions our results suggest dividend announcement returns reflect information about the level of permanent earnings though the timing of the information content is difficult to reconcile with traditional signaling models
using data on over lowincome tax filers we estimate the effect of medicaid access on the propensity of households to save or repay debt from their tax refunds we instrument for medicaid access using variation in state eligibility rules we find substanital heterogeneity across households in the savings response to medicaid households that are not experiencing financial hardship behave in a manner consistent with a precautionary savings model meaning they save less under medicaid in contrast among households experiencing financial hardship medicaid eligibility increases refund savings rates by roughly percentage points or for both sets of households effects are stronger in states with lower bankruptcy exemption limits consistent with uninsured financially constrained households using bankruptcy to manage health expenditure risk our results imply that expansions to the social safety net may affect the magnitude of the consumption response to tax rebates elsevier bv
we study the international propagation of longrun risk in the context of a general equilibrium model with endogenous growth innovation and international diffusion of technologies are the channels at the core of our mechanism a calibrated version of the model matches several asset pricing and macroeconomic quantity moments alleviating some of the puzzles highlighted in the international macrofinance literature our model predicts that country pairs that share more research and development rd have less volatile exchange rates and more correlated stock market returns using data from a sample of developed countries we provide suggestive empirical evidence in favor of our models predictions
preemptive rights are thought to protect minority shareholders from cheapstock tunneling by a controlling shareholder we show that preemptive rights while making cheapstock tunneling more difficult cannot prevent it when asymmetric information about the value of the offered shares makes it impossible for the minority to know whether these shares are cheap or overpriced our analysis can help explain why sophisticated investors in unlisted firms and regulators of listed firms do not rely entirely on preemptive rights to address cheapstock tunneling supplementing them with other restrictions on equity issues elsevier bv
we analyze a model in which information may be voluntarily disclosed by a firm andor by a third party eg financial analysts due to its strategic nature corporate voluntary disclosure is qualitatively different from thirdparty disclosure greater analyst coverage crowds out crowds in corporate voluntary disclosure when analysts mostly discover information that is available unavailable to the firm nevertheless greater analyst coverage always improves the overall quality of public information we base this claim on two market quality measures price efficiency which is statistical in nature and liquidity which is derived in a trading stage that follows the disclosure stage elsevier bv
we study the impact of marital property legislation passed in the us south in the s on households investment in risky entrepreneurial projects these laws protected the assets of newly married women from creditors in a world of virtually unlimited liability we compare couples married after the passage of a marital property law with couples from the same state who were married before consistent with a simple model of household borrowing that trades off agency costs against risk sharing the effect on investment was heterogeneous it increased if most household property came from the husband and decreased if most came from the wife
we show that hedge funds gain an information advantage from their prime broker banks regarding the banks corporate borrowers the connected hedge funds make abnormally large trades in the stocks of borrowing firms prior to loan announcements and these trades outperform other trades the outperformance is particularly strong for trades of hedge funds that have high revenue potential for prime broker banks these informed trades appear to be based on information not just about the loan itself but also about firms fundamentals such as future earnings finally we find evidence suggesting that equity analysts inside the banks are one potential conduit of information transfer elsevier bv
this paper finds that stricter laws regulating thirdparty debt collection reduce the number of thirdparty debt collectors lower the recovery rates on delinquent credit card loans and lead to a modest decrease in the openings of new revolving lines of credit further stricter thirdparty debt collection laws are associated with fewer consumer lawsuits against thirdparty debt collectors but not with a reduction in the overall number of consumer complaints overall stricter thirdparty debt collection laws appear to restrict access to new revolving credit but have an ambiguous effect on the nonpecuniary costs that the debt collection process imposes on borrowers elsevier bv
past studies typically have focused on whether people perceive more rare risk after experiencing catastrophic disasters we show that people can also feel less risk with unexpected lucky disaster experience by exploring a novel identification strategy based on households expectations we find that households perceive less more risk when they experience disasters that have lower higher fatalities than what was expected this opposite experience effect of rare disasters is substantial a one standard deviation increase in the negative positive experience shock is associated with a decrease a increase in the life insurancetoportfolio ratio we discuss three possible mechanisms to account for our empirical findings incomplete information learning salience theory and change in risk preferences
using a comprehensive sample of credit card data from a leading chinese bank we show that government bureaucrats receive higher credit lines than nonbureaucrats with similar income and demographics but their accounts experience a significantly higher likelihood of delinquency and debt forgiveness regions associated with greater credit provision to bureaucrats open more branches and receive more deposits from the local government after staggered corruption crackdowns of provinciallevel political officials the new credit cards originated to bureaucrats in exposed regions do not enjoy a credit line premium and bureaucrats delinquency and reinstatement rates are similar to those of nonbureaucrats elsevier bv
we derive a measure that captures the extent to which common ownership shifts managers incentives to internalize externalities a key feature of the measure is that it allows for the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a managers actions benefit the investors overall portfolio empirically we show that potential drivers of common ownership including mergers in the asset management industry and under certain circumstances even indexing could diminish managerial motives to internalize externalities our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor inattention when analyzing whether the growth of common ownership affects managerial incentives
we find evidence consistent with previously unrecognized market manipulation by brokerdealers specifically we show that pretrade hedging which is distinct from frontrunning alters prices at which derivative trades occur we show this behavior is intentional by exploiting variation in the design of structured equity products seps we find positive abnormal returns on sep pricing dates for which issuers benefit from altering closing stock prices but no such returns on pricing dates of otherwise similar seps we also show that large buy trades near the close of trading are more frequent when sep issuers have incentives to alter closing stock prices
we allow a strategic trader to choose when to acquire information about an assets payoff instead of endowing her with it when the trader dynamically controls the precision of a flow of information the optimal precision evolves stochastically and increases with market liquidity because the trader exploits her information gradually the equilibrium price impact and market uncertainty are unaffected by her rate of acquisition if she pays a fixed cost to acquire lumpy information at a time of her choosing the market can break down we show that no equilibria exist with endogenous information acquisition our analysis suggests caution when applying insights from standard strategic trading models to settings with information acquisition elsevier bv
we examine ceoboard dynamics using a new panel dataset that spans to the long sample allows us to perform withinfirm and withinceo tests over a long horizon many for the first time in the governance literature consistent with theories of bargaining or dynamic contracting we find board independence increases at ceo turnover and falls with ceo tenure with the decline stronger following superior performance ceos are also more likely to be appointed board chair as tenure increases and we find evidence consistent with a substitution between board independence and chair duality other results suggest that these classes of models fail to capture important elements of board dynamics first the magnitude of the ceo tenure effect is economically small much smaller for example than the strong persistence in board structure that we show second when external ceos are hired board independence falls and subsequently increases third event studies show a positive market reaction when powerful ceos die in office consistent with powerful ceos becoming entrenched
this paper develops a novel measure of liquidity supply by brokerdealers using data on their trading positions in treasury bonds and the deviations of treasury yields from a fitted yield curve the measure is informative about liquidity in other asset classes including corporate bonds and equities a decline in liquidity supply predicts reduced debt issuance and investment by nonfinancial firms and reduced aggregate economic activity the sensitivity of liquidity issuance and investment to brokerdealers liquidity supply is larger for firms with low credit quality the results suggest that securities intermediaries are important for understanding liquidity commonality corporate financing and real activity
